<h2>BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h3>By J. M. BULLOCH</h3>
</div>

<p>José Maria Jacobo Rafael Ramon Francisco Gabriel
del Corazon de Jesus Gordon y Prendergast&mdash;to give
the writer of this book the full name with which he was
christened in Jeréz de la Frontera on March 19, 1856&mdash;belongs
to an interesting, but unusual, type of the Scot
abroad.</p>
<p>These virile venturers group themselves into four categories.
Illustrating them by reference to the Gordons
alone, there was the venturer, usually a soldier of fortune,
who died in the country of his adoption, such as the well-known
General Patrick Gordon, of Auchleuchries, Aberdeenshire
(1635-1690), who, having spent thirty-nine years
of faithful service to Peter the Great, died and was
buried at Moscow. Or one might cite John Gordon, of
Lord Byron&#8217;s Gight family, who, having helped to
assassinate Wallenstein in the town of Eger, in 1634,
turned himself into a Dutch Jonkheer, dying at Dantzig,
and being buried at Delft.</p>
<p>Sometimes, especially in the case of merchants, the
venturers settled down permanently in their new fatherland,
as in the case of the Gordons of Coldwells, Aberdeenshire,
who are now represented solely by the family of
von Gordon-Coldwells, in Laskowitz. So rapid was the
transformation of this family that when one of them,
Colonel Fabian Gordon, of the Polish cavalry, turned up
in Edinburgh in 1783, in connexion with the sale of the
family heritage, he knew so little English that he had to
be initiated a Freemason in Latin. To this day there is
a family in Warsaw which, ignoring our principle of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
primogeniture, calls itself the Marquises de Huntly-Gordon.</p>
<p>Occasionally the exiles returned home, either to succeed
to the family heritage, or to rescue it from ruin with the
wealth they had acquired abroad. Thus General Alexander
Gordon (1669-1751) of the Russian army, the biographer
of Peter the Great, came home to succeed his father as
laird of Auchintoul, Banffshire, and managed by a legal
mistake to hold it in face of forfeiture for Jacobitism. His
line has long since died out, as soldier stock is apt to do&mdash;an
ironic symbol of the death-dealing art. But the descendants
of another ardent Jacobite, Robert Gordon, wine
merchant, Bordeaux, who rescued the family estate of
Hallhead, Aberdeenshire, from clamant creditors, still
flourish. One of them became famous in the truest spirit
of Gay Gordonism, in the person of Adam Lindsay
Gordon, the beloved laureate of Australia.</p>
<p>The vineyard and Australia bring us to the fourth, and
rarest, category, represented by the writer of this book,
namely, the family which has not only retained its Scots
heritage, but also flourishes in the land of its adoption,
for Mr. Rafael Gordon is not only laird of Wardhouse,
Aberdeenshire, but is a Spaniard by birth and education,
and a citizen of Madrid: and this double citizenship has
been shared by his uncles Pedro Carlos Gordon (1806-1857),
Rector of Stonyhurst; and General J. M. Gordon, the
writer of this book, who will long be remembered as the
pioneer of national service in Australia.</p>
<p>The Gordons of Wardhouse, to whom he belongs, are
descended (as the curious will find set forth in detail
in the genealogical table) from a Churchman, Adam
Gordon, Dean of Caithness (died 1528), younger son of
the first Earl of Huntly, and they have remained staunch
to the Church of Rome to this day: that indeed was one of
the reasons for their sojourning aboard. The Dean&#8217;s son
George (died 1575) acquired the lands of Beldorney,
Aberdeenshire, which gradually became frittered away by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
his senior descendants, the seventh laird parting with the
property to the younger line in the person of Alexander
Gordon, of Camdell, Banffshire, in 1703, while his sons
vanished to America, where they are untraceable.</p>
<p>From this point the fortunes of the families increase.
Alexander&#8217;s son James, IX of Beldorney, bought the
ancient estate of Kildrummy in 1731, and Wardhouse
came into his family through his marriage with Mary
Gordon, heiress thereof. This reinforcement of his
Gordon blood was one of the deciding causes of the strong
Jacobitism of his son John, the tenth laird, who fought at
Culloden, which stopped his half Russian wife, Margaret
Smyth of Methven, the great grand-daughter of General
Patrick Gordon of Auchleuchries, in the act of embroidering
for Prince Charles a scarlet waistcoat, which came to
the hammer at Aberdeen in 1898.</p>
<p>This Jacobite laird&#8217;s brothers were the first to go
abroad. One of them, Gregory, appears to have entered
the Dutch service; another, Charles, a priest, was educated
at Ratisbon; and a third, Robert, settled at Cadiz. That
was the first association of the Wardhouse Gordons with
Spain, for, though Robert died without issue, he seems
to have settled one of his nephews, Robert (son of his
brother Cosmo, who had gone to Jamaica), and another,
James Arthur Gordon (who was son of the twelfth laird),
at Jeréz.</p>
<p>But the sense of adventure was also strong on the
family at home, especially on Alexander, the eleventh
laird, who was executed as a spy at Brest in 1769. A
peculiarly handsome youth, who succeeded to the estates
in 1760, he started life as an ensign in the 49th Foot in
1766. He narrowly escaped being run through in a brawl
at Edinburgh, and, taking a hair of the dog that had
nearly bitten him, he fatally pinked a butcher in the city of
Cork in 1767. He escaped to La Rochelle, and ultimately
got into touch with Lord Harcourt, our Ambassador in
Paris. Harcourt sent the reckless lad to have a look at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
the fortifications of Brest. He was caught in the act; Harcourt
repudiated all knowledge of him; and he was executed
November 24, 1769, gay to the end, and attracting
the eyes of every pretty girl in the town. The guillotine
which did its worst is still preserved in the arsenal
at Brest, and the whole story is set forth with legal precision
in the transactions of the Societé Academique de
Brest.</p>
<p>Poor Alexander was succeeded as laird by his younger
brother Charles Edward (1750-1832), who became an
officer in the Northern Fencibles, and was not without
his share of adventure, which curiously enough arose out
of his brother&#8217;s regiment, the 49th. He married as his
second wife Catherine Mercer, the daughter of James
Mercer, the poet, who had been a major in that regiment.
In 1797, his commanding officer, Colonel John Woodford,
who had married his chief, the Duke of Gordon&#8217;s, sister,
bolted at Hythe with the lady, from whom the laird of
Wardhouse duly got a divorce. That did not satisfy
Gordon, who thrashed his colonel with a stick in the streets
of Ayr. Of course he was court-martialled, but Woodford&#8217;s
uncle-in-law, Lord Adam Gordon, as Commander-in-Chief
of North Britain, smoothed over the sentence of
dismissal from the Fencibles by getting the angry husband
appointed paymaster in the Royal Scots.</p>
<p>Gordon&#8217;s eldest son John David, by his first marriage
(with the grand-daughter of the Earl of Kilmarnock, who
was executed at the Tower with Lord Lovat), had wisely
kept out of temptation amid the peaceful family vineyards
at Jeréz, from which he returned in 1832 to Wardhouse.
But John David&#8217;s half-brother stayed at home and became
Admiral Sir James Alexander Gordon (1782-1869),
who as the &#8220;last of Nelson&#8217;s Captains&#8221; roused the admiration
of Tom Hughes in a fine appreciation in <i>Macmillan&#8217;s
Magazine</i>. Although he had lost his leg in the capture
of the Pomone in 1812, he could stump on foot even as
an old man all the way from Westminster to Greenwich
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
Hospital, of which he was the last Governor, and where
you can see his portrait to this day.</p>
<p>Although John David Gordon succeeded to Wardhouse,
his family remained essentially Spanish, and his
own tastes, as his grandson, General Gordon, points out,
were coloured by the character of the Peninsula. The
General himself, as his autobiography shows in every
page, has had his inherited Gay Gordonism aided and
abetted by his associations with Spain and with Australia.
His whole career has been full of enterprising adventure,
and, while intensely interested in big imperial problems,
he has an inevitable sense of the colour and rhythm of
life as soldier, as policeman, as sportsman, as actor, as
journalist. He is, in short, a perfect example of a Gay
Gordon.

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>MY SCOTS-SPANISH ORIGIN</h3>
</div>

<p>At a period in the history of Scotland, we find that a law
was passed under the provisions of which every landowner
who was a Catholic had either to renounce his adherence
to his Church or to forfeit his landed property to the
Crown. This was a severe blow to Scotsmen, and history
tells that practically every Catholic laird preferred not to
have his property confiscated, with the natural result that
he ceased&mdash;at any rate publicly&mdash;to take part in the outward
forms of the Catholic religion. Churches, which
Catholic families had built and endowed, passed into the
hands of other denominations. Catholic priests who&mdash;in
devotion to their duty&mdash;were willing to risk their lives,
had to practise their devotions in secrecy.</p>
<p>My great grandfather, Charles Edward Gordon (1754-1832),
then quite a young man, happened to be one of
those lairds who submitted to the law, preferring to remain
lairds. His younger brother, James Arthur (1759-1824),
who chanced to be possessed in his own right of a certain
amount of hard cash, began to think seriously. It appeared
to him that, if a law could be passed confiscating
landed property unless the owners gave up the Catholic
religion, there was no reason why another law should not
be passed confiscating actual cash under similar conditions.
The more he turned this over in his mind, the surer he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
became that at any rate the passing of such a second law
could not be deemed illogical. He was by no means the
only one of the younger sons of Scots families who thought
likewise. It seemed to him that it would be wise to leave
the country&mdash;at any rate for a while.</p>
<p>In those days there were no Canadas, Australias and
other new and beautiful countries appealing to these adventurous
spirits, but there were European countries where
a field was open for their enterprise. My great grand-uncle&mdash;youthful
as he was&mdash;decided that the South of
Spain, Andalusia, La Tierra de Santa Maria, would suit
him, and he removed himself and his cash to that sunny
land. It is there that the oranges flourish on the banks
of the Guadalquivir. It is there that the green groves of
olive trees yield their plentiful crops. It is there that the
vine brings forth that rich harvest of grapes whose succulent
juice becomes the nectar of the gods in the shape of
sherry wine. He decided that white sherry wine offered
the best commercial result and resolved to devote himself
to its production. Business went well with him. It was
prosperous; the wine became excellent and the drinkers
many.</p>
<p>By this time his brother had married and the union
had been blessed with two sons. When the elder was
fifteen years old, it appeared to his uncle James Arthur
that it would be a good thing if his brother, the laird,
would send the boy to Spain, to be brought up there, with
a view to his finally joining him in the business. He
decided, therefore, to visit his brother in Scotland, with
this object in view. He did so, but the laird did not
appear to be kindly inclined to this arrangement. He was
willing, however, to let his second son go to Spain, finish
his education, and then take on the wine business. This
was not what the uncle wanted. He wished for the elder
son, the young laird, or for nobody at all. The matter
fell through and the uncle returned to the Sunny South.</p>
<p>A couple of years later on, the laird changed his mind,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
wrote to his brother, and offered to send his eldest son,
John David (1774-1850). A short time afterwards the
young laird arrived in Spain. His father, the laird, lived
for many years, during which time&mdash;after the death of his
uncle&mdash;his eldest son had become the head of one of the
most successful sherry wine firms that existed in those
days in Spain. He had married in Spain and had had a
large family, who had all grown up, and had married also
in that country, and it was not till he was some sixty
years of age that his father, the laird, died and he
succeeded to the Scots properties of Wardhouse and
Kildrummy Castle.</p>
<p>The law with reference to the forfeiture of lands held
by Catholics had become practically void, so that he duly
succeeded to the estates. The old laird had driven over
in his coach to the nearest Catholic place of worship and
had been received back into the Church of his fathers.
Afterwards he had given a great feast to his friends, at
which plenty of good old port was drunk to celebrate the
occasion. He drove back to his home, and on arrival at
the house was found dead in the coach. So we children,
when told this story, said that he had only got to Heaven
by the skin of his teeth.</p>
<p>His successor, my grandfather, John David, died in
1850 in Spain, and my father&#8217;s elder brother, Pedro Carlos
(1806-1857), became the laird and took up his residence in
the old home. He broke the record in driving the mail
coach from London to York without leaving the box seat.
And later on, in Aberdeen, he drove his four-in-hand at
full gallop into Castlehill Barracks. Anyone who knows
the old gateway will appreciate the feat.</p>
<p>On his death in 1857, his son, my cousin, Juan José
(1837-1866), succeeded to the property. He, of course,
had also been brought up in Spain, and was married to a
cousin, and sister of the Conde de Mirasol, but had no
children. When he took up his residence as laird, most
of his friends, naturally, were Spanish visitors whom he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
amused by building a bull-fighting ring not far from the
house, importing bulls from Spain and holding amateur
bull-fights on Sunday afternoons. This was a sad blow
indeed to the sedate Presbyterians in the neighbourhood.
His life, however, was short, and, as he left no children,
the properties passed to my father, Carlos Pedro (1814-1897),
by entail.</p>
<p>It is necessary to have written this short history of the
family, from my great grandfather&#8217;s time, to let you know
how I came to be born in Spain, and how our branch of
the family was the only one of the clan which remained
Catholic in spite of the old Scots law.</p>
<p>I would like to tell you something now about Jeréz,
the place where I was born, and where the sherry white
wine comes from. Yet all the wine is not really white.
There is good brown sherry, and there is just as good
golden sherry, and there is Pedro Ximenez. If you
haven&#8217;t tasted them, try them as soon as you get the
chance. You&#8217;ll like the last two&mdash;and very much&mdash;after
dinner. I am not selling any, but you&#8217;ll find plenty of
firms about Mark Lane who will be quite willing to supply
you if you wish.</p>
<p>Well, Jeréz is a town of some sixty thousand inhabitants.
Don&#8217;t be afraid. This is not going to be a guidebook,
for Jeréz has not a single public building worth
the slightest notice, not even a church of which it can
be said that it is really worth visiting compared with
other cities, either from an architectural or an artistic point
of view. It is wanting in the beautiful and wonderful
attractions which adorn many of the Andalusian towns
that surround it. In Jeréz there are no glorious edifices
dating back to the occupation of the Moors (except the
Alcazar&mdash;now part cinema-show). There are no royal
palaces taken from the Moors by Spanish kings. There
is no Seville Cathedral, no Giralda. There is no Alhambra
as there is in Granada. There are only parts of the ancient
walls that enclosed the old city. The Moors apparently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
thought little of Jeréz; they evidently had not discovered
the glories of sherry white wine.</p>
<p>Jeréz seems to have devoted all its energies to the erection
of wine-cellars, the most uninteresting buildings in
the world. A visitor, after a couple of days in Jeréz,
would be tired of its uninteresting streets, badly kept
squares and absence of any places of interest or picturesque
drives. Probably he would note the presence of the stately
and silent ciguenas, who make their home and build their
nests upon the top of every church steeple or tower. They
are not exciting, but there they have been for years, and
there they are now, and it is to be presumed that there
they will remain. Yet, Jeréz is a pleasant place to live in.
Although there is only one decent hotel in it, there are
excellent private houses, full of many comforts and works
of art, though their comfort and beauty is all internal.
They are mostly situated in side streets, with no attempt
at any outside architectural effects.</p>
<p>The citizens of Jeréz are quite content with Jeréz. They
love to take their ease, and have a decided objection to
hustle. The womenkind dearly love big families: the
bigger they are the better they like them. They are
devoted to their husbands and children, and live for them.
The men cannot be called ambitious, but they are perfectly
satisfied with their quiet lives, and with looking after their
own businesses. They love to sit in their clubs and cafés,
sit either inside or at tables on the pavements in the street&mdash;and
talk politics, bull-fights, and about the weather, in
fact any topic which comes handy; and they are quite
content, as a rule, to talk on, no matter if they are not
being listened to. This habit of general talk without
listeners is also common to the ladies. To be present at
a re-union of ladies and listen to the babble of their sweet
tongues is a pleasure which a lazy man can thoroughly
enjoy.</p>
<p>The local Press is represented principally by three or
four&mdash;mostly one-sheet&mdash;newspapers, which you can read
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
in about three minutes. Of course their all-absorbing
interest, as regards sport, is centred in the bull-fights.
For three months before the bull-fighting season begins&mdash;which
is about Easter&mdash;people talk of nothing but bulls
and matadors. The relative merits of the different studs
which are to supply, not only the local corridas, but
practically the tip-top ones throughout the chief cities of
Spain, are discussed over and over again, while the
admirers of Joselito (since killed) are as lavish in words
and gestures of praise as are those of Belmonte, while, at
the same time, the claims of other aspirants to championship
as matadors are heard on every side.</p>
<p>Once the season begins&mdash;it lasts until towards the end
of October&mdash;the whole of everybody&#8217;s time is, of course,
mostly taken up in commenting upon the merits or demerits
of each and every corrida. There does not appear
to be time for much else to be talked about then; unless
an election comes along, and that thoroughly rouses the
people for the time being. It is of very little use for
anyone to attempt to describe upon what lines elections
are run in Spain. One has to be there to try and discover
what principles guide them. For instance, the last
time I was in Spain Parliamentary elections were to take
place the very week after Easter Sunday. On that day the
first bull-fight of the season was to take place at Puerto
Santa Maria, a small town about ten miles from Jeréz.
Of course a large number of sports, with their ladies,
motored or drove over for the occasion.</p>
<p>There was an immense crowd at Puerto Santa Maria.
In the south of Spain, especially at a bull-fight, Jack is as
good as his master, and each one has to battle through the
crowd as best he can. I personally was relieved of my
gold watch, sovereign case and chain in the most perfect
manner; so perfect that I had not the least idea when or
how it was taken. I must confess I felt very sad over it;
not so much over my actual loss, but, I <i>did</i> think it most
unkind and thoughtless of my fellow townsmen to select
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
me as their victim. The next morning I reported my loss
to the Mayor of Jeréz. He didn&#8217;t appear to be much concerned
about it, and he informed me that he had already
had some forty similar complaints of the loss of watches,
pocket-books, etc., from visitors to Puerto Santa Maria
from Jeréz the day previous. He had had a telegram also
from the Mayor of Puerto Santa Maria to the effect that
some seventy like cases had been reported to him in that
town.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that, after all,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t really see any
particular reason why you should be hurt. I may tell you
that you are in good company. General Primo de Rivera&#8221;
(who was then Captain-General Commanding the Military
District) &#8220;was with a friend when he saw a man take the
latter&#8217;s pocket-book from inside his coat. He fortunately
grabbed the thief before he could make off. One of the
Ministers of State was successfully robbed of some thirty
pounds in notes; while a friend of yours&#8221; (mentioning
a business man in Jeréz who hadn&#8217;t even been to the
bull-fight, but had been collecting rents at Cadiz, and was
returning through Puerto Santa Maria home) &#8220;was surprised
to find on his arrival there, that the large sum,
which should have been in his pocket had evidently
passed, somehow or other, into some other fellow&#8217;s hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, of course, somewhat cheered me up, because,
after all, there is no doubt that a common affliction makes
us very sympathetic. I asked him how he accounted for
this wonderful display of sleight-of-hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know that the elections are
on this week, and that usually, before the elections, the
party in power takes the opportunity of letting out of gaol
as many criminals as it dares, hoping for and counting on
their votes? Of course, the responsibility falls on the heads
of the police for making some effort to protect our easy-going
and unsuspicious visitors at such times. The job
is too big for us at the time being, with the result that
these gentry make a good harvest. But yet, after all, we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
are not really downhearted about it, because, after the
elections are over, especially if the opposition party gets
in, we round them all up and promptly lock them up
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The explanation, though quite clear, didn&#8217;t seem to me
to be of much help towards getting back my goods and
chattels, so I ventured to ask again whether he thought
there was any chance at all of my recovering them, or of
his recovering them for me. He smiled a sweet smile, and&mdash;shaking
his head, I regret to say, in a negative way&mdash;answered
that he thought there was not the slightest hope,
as, from the description of the watch, chain, etc., which
I had given him, he had no doubt that they had by that
time passed through the melting pot, so that it was not even
worth while to offer a reward.</p>
<p>The house where I was born was at that time one of
the largest in the city. It is situated almost in the centre
of Jeréz, and occupies a very large block of ground, for
in addition to the house itself and gardens, the wine-cellars,
the cooperage, stables and other accessory buildings
attached to them, were all grouped round it. To-day
a holy order of nuns occupies it as a convent. No longer
is heard the crackling of the fires and the hammering of
the iron hoops in the cooperage. No longer the teams of
upstanding mules, with the music of their brass bells, are
seen leaving the cellars with their load of the succulent
wine. No longer is the air filled with that odour which is
so well known to those whose lives are spent amidst the
casks in which the wine is maturing. Instead, peace and
quiet reign. Sacrificing their time to the interests of
charity, the holy sisters dwell in peace.</p>
<p>Two recollections of some of my earliest days are somewhat
vivid. I seem to remember hearing the deep sound
of a bell in the streets, looking out of the window and
seeing an open cart&mdash;full of dead bodies&mdash;stopping before
the door of a house, from which one more dead body was
added to the funeral pile. That was the year of the great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
cholera epidemic. And again, I remember hearing bells
early, very early, in the morning. We knew what that
was. It was the donkey-man coming round to sell the
donkeys&#8217; milk at the front door, quite warm and frothy.</p>
<p>My early school days in Spain were quite uneventful.
After attending a day-school at Jeréz, kept by Don José
Rincon, I went into the Jesuit College at Puerto Real for
a year. A new college was being built at Puerto Santa
Maria, to which the school was transferred, and it has been
added to since. It is now one of the best colleges in the
south of Spain.</p>
<p>On the death of my cousin, the entailed properties&mdash;as
I have said&mdash;became my father&#8217;s, and the family left
Spain to take up its residence in Scotland.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>MY SCHOOLING</h3>
</div>

<p>The journey from Jeréz to Scotland must have been full
of interest and excitement for my father. Our party
numbered about thirty of all ages, down to a couple of
babies, my sister&#8217;s children. My father found it more
practicable to arrange for what was then called a family
train to take us through Spain and France. We travelled
during the day and got shunted at night. Sometimes we
slept in the carriages; other times at hotels. In either case,
as a rule, there were frequent and&mdash;for a time&mdash;hard-fought
battles among us young ones of both sexes for choice of
sleeping places.</p>
<p>At meal times there were often considerable scrambles.
We all seemed to have the same tastes and we all wanted
the same things. My parents (who, poor dears, had to
put up with us, and the Spanish nurses and servants, who
had never left their own homes before, and who, the farther
we got, seemed to think that they were never going to
return to them) at last came to the conclusion that any
attempts at punishing us were without satisfactory results,
and that appealing to our love for them (for it was no use
appealing to our love for each other) and our honour paid
better.</p>
<p>My elder sisters and brothers, who were in the party,
knew English. I did not. Not a word except two, and
those were &#8220;all right,&#8221; which, immediately on arrival at
Dover and all the way to London, I called out to every
person I met.</p>
<p>On reaching Charing Cross the party was to have a
meal previous to starting up to Scotland. The station
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
restaurant manager was somewhat surprised when my
father informed him that he wanted a table for about thirty
persons, which, however, he arranged for. The Spanish
nurses and women-servants were dressed after the style
of their own country. They, of course, wore no hats, their
hair being beautifully done with flowers at the side (which
had to be provided for them whether we wished it or not),
and characteristic shawls graced their shoulders. So that
the little party at the table was quite an object of interest,
not only to those others who were dining at the time, but
also to a great many ordinary passengers who practically
were blocking the entrance to the restaurant in order to
obtain a glimpse of the foreigners.</p>
<p>All went well until the chef, with the huge sirloin of
beef upon the travelling table, appeared upon the scene.
No sooner did he begin to carve and the red, juicy gravy
of the much under-done beef appeared, than the nurses
rose in a body, dropped the babies and bolted through
the door on to the platform. They thought they were
going to be asked to eat raw meat. Of course, they had
never seen a joint in Spain. On their leaving, we, the
younger members of the family, were told to run after them
and catch them if we could. So off we went, and then began
such a chase through the station as I doubt if Charing
Cross had ever witnessed before or has since. The station
police and porters, not understanding what was going on,
naturally started chasing and catching us youngsters, much
to the amusement and bewilderment of those looking on.
Meanwhile my father stood at the entrance of the
restaurant, sad but resigned, and it was after some considerable
time and after the removal of the offending joint,
that the family party was again gathered together in peace
and quiet, and shortly afterwards proceeded on the last
stage of its journey and arrived safely at the old family
home, which stands amidst some of the most beautiful
woods in Scotland. It is very old, but not so old as the
family itself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>My father decided that it would be better for me to
get a little knowledge of the English language before he
sent me to school, so that I might be able to look after
myself when there. I was handed over to the care of the
head gamekeeper, Thomas Kennedy. Dear Tom died three
years ago, at a very old age; rather surprising he lived
so long, as he had for years to look after me. To him,
from the start, I was &#8220;Master Joseph,&#8221; and &#8220;Master
Joseph&#8221; I remained until I embraced the old chap the last
time I saw him before he died. It was from Tom Kennedy
that I first learnt English, mixed with the broad Aberdeen-Scots,
which when combined with my Spanish accent was
practically a language of my own.</p>
<p>I wonder if Britons have any idea how difficult it is,
especially for one whose native tongue is of the Latin
origin, to get a thorough knowledge and grasp of their
language. To my mind, the English language is not
founded on any particular rules or principles. No matter
how words are spelt, they have got to be pronounced just
as the early Britons decided. There is no particular rule;
if you want to spell properly, you pretty well have to
learn to spell each word on its own. This is proved by the
fact that the spelling of their own language correctly is
certainly not one of the proud achievements of their own
race. In the good old days before the War it may be
stated without exaggeration that one of the greatest
stumbling blocks in the public examinations&mdash;especially
those for entrance into Woolwich and Sandhurst&mdash;was
the qualification test in spelling. There must be thousands
of candidates still alive who well remember receiving the
foolscap blue envelopes notifying them that there was no
further necessity for their presence at the examination as
they had failed to qualify in spelling. As regards the
pronunciation of words as you find them written, it is
quite an art to hit them off right. Still, perseverance,
patience and a good memory finally come to the rescue,
and the result is then quite gratifying.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>It was from Tom Kennedy that I also learnt to shoot,
fish, ride and drink, for Tom always had a little flask
of whisky to warm us up when we were sitting in the
snow and waiting for the rabbits to bolt, or&mdash;what often
took a great deal longer time&mdash;waiting for the ferrets to
come out. And&mdash;last but not least&mdash;he taught me to
smoke. I well remember Tom&#8217;s short black pipe and his
old black twist tobacco. I shall never forget the times
I had and the physical and mental agonies I endured in
trying to enjoy that pipe.</p>
<p>So six months passed away and I was sent, with my
two elder brothers, to the Oratory School in Edgware
Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham. The head of the school
was the celebrated Doctor, and later on Cardinal, Newman.
Even to this day my recollections of that ascetic holy
man are most vivid. At that time his name was a household
word in religious controversy. He stood far above
his contemporaries, whether they were those who agreed
with or differed from his views. He was respected by all,
loved by those who followed him; never hated, but somewhat
feared, by those who opposed him. I remember
that one of the greatest privileges to which the boys at
our school at that time looked forward, was being selected
to go and listen to Doctor Newman playing the violin.
Five or six of us were taken to his study in the evening.
In mute silence, with rapt attention, we watched the thin-featured
man, whose countenance to us seemed to belong
even then to a world beyond this, and we listened to what
to us seemed the sweetest sounding music.</p>
<p>But yet there are other recollections which were not so
pleasant. The head prefect was a man of very different
physical qualities. Dear Father St. John Ambrose erred
on the side of physical attainments. He was by no means
thin or ascetic. He possessed a powerful arm, which he
wielded with very considerable freedom when applying
the birch in the recesses of the boot-room. I must admit
that my interviews with Father St. John in the boot-room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
were not infrequent. But, after all, the immediate effect
soon passed away and the incident was forgotten. Still,
to my surprise, when the school accounts were rendered
at the end of the year, my father was puzzled over one
item, namely, &#8220;Birches&mdash;£1 2s. 6d.&#8221; (at the rate of half a
crown each)! He asked me what it meant, and I explained
to him as best I could that dear Father St. John was really
the responsible person in the matter, and I had no doubt
my father would get a full explanation from him if he
wrote. But it brought home to me the recollection of
nine visits to the boot-room with that amiable and
much-respected Father St. John. I have within the last
few months met again, after my long absence in other
countries, several of my school mates. They are all going
strong and well, holding high positions in this world,
and as devoted as ever to the old school at Edgbaston.
One of them is now Viscount Fitzalan, Viceroy of Ireland.</p>
<p>When my two elder brothers left the Oratory, which I
may say was a school where the boys were allowed very
considerable liberty, my father must have thought, no
doubt, when he remembered the twenty-two and sixpence
for birches, that it would be wise to send me somewhere
where the rules of the college were, in his opinion, somewhat
stricter. So off I was sent, early in 1870, to dear
old Beaumont College, the Jesuit school, situated in that
beautiful spot on the River Thames just where the old
hostelry The Bells of Ouseley still exists, at the foot of
the range of hills which the glorious Burnham Beeches
adorn. The original house was once the home of Warren
Hastings. Four delightful years of school life followed.
It was a pleasure to me to find that there was no extra
charge for birches. The implement that was used to
conserve discipline was not made out of the pliable birch
tree, but of a very solid piece of leather with some stiffening
to it&mdash;I fancy of steel&mdash;called a &#8220;ferrula.&#8221; This was
applied to the palm of the hand, and not to where my
old friend the birch found its billet. As the same ferrula
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
not only lasted a long time without detriment to itself,
but, on the contrary, seemed rather to improve with age,
the authorities were kind enough not to charge for its
use.</p>
<p>No event of any particular interest, except perhaps
being taught cricket by old John Lillywhite, with his very
best top hat of those days, and battles fought on the football
ground against rival colleges, occurred until the end
of the third year. I happened to have come out, at the
end of that year, top of my class. I had practically won
most of the prizes. It was the custom of the school that
the senior boys of the upper classes were permitted to
study more advanced subjects than the school had actually
laid down for the curriculum of that particular class for
the year. These extra subjects were called &#8220;honours.&#8221;
They were studied in voluntary time; the examinations
therein and the marks gained in no way counted towards
the result of the class examinations for the year.</p>
<p>These class examinations were held before the
&#8220;honours&#8221; examination. A friend of mine in a higher
class, who was sitting behind me in the study room, asked
me if I&#8217;d like to read an English translation of &#8220;Cæsar.&#8221;
I promptly said &#8220;Yes&#8221; and borrowed it, and was soon
lost in its perusal, with my elbows on my desk and my
head between my hands. Presently I felt a gentle tap
on my shoulder. I looked up to see the prefect of studies
standing by me. He told me afterwards that he had
thought, from the interest I was taking in my book, that
I was reading some naughty and forbidden novel, which
he intended to confiscate, of course, and probably read.
He was surprised to find it was an old friend, &#8220;Cæsar.&#8221;
Being an English translation it was considered to be a
&#8220;crib.&#8221; He asked me where I had got it. I couldn&#8217;t
give away my pal, just behind me, so I said I didn&#8217;t
know. &#8220;Don&#8217;t add impertinence to the fact that you&#8217;ve
got a &#8216;crib.&#8217; Just tell me where you did get this book,&#8221;
he remarked. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be impertinent,&#8221; I said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
&#8220;but I refuse to tell you.&#8221; &#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;go
straight to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard nothing more on the subject till a few days
afterwards, at the presentation of the prizes, the breaking-up
day, on which occasion the parents and friends of the
scholars were invited to be present. At an interval in
the performance the prizes were presented. The prefect
of studies would begin to read from the printed prize list,
which all the visitors were supplied with, the names of all
the fortunate prize winners in succession, from the highest
to the lowest. As the name of each prize winner was called
he stood up, walked to the table at which the prizes were
presented, received his, and, after making a polite bow,
returned to his seat.</p>
<p>When the prefect of studies reached the class to which
I belonged he called out: &#8220;Grammar, first prize. Aggregate
for the year, Joseph M. Gordon.&#8221; Upon which I
rose from my seat, and for a moment the applause of the
audience, which was freely given to all prize winners,
followed. I was on the point of moving off towards the
table in question, when, as the applause ceased, the voice
of the prefect of studies once more made itself clearly
heard. It was only one word he said, but that word was
&#8220;Forfeited.&#8221; No more. I sat down again. Then he
continued: &#8220;First prize in Latin, J. M. G.&#8221; I must admit
I didn&#8217;t know what to do, but I stood up all right again.
The audience didn&#8217;t quite appear to understand what was
going on, but the prefect of studies gave them no time to
commence any further applause, for that one word,
&#8220;Forfeited,&#8221; came quickly out of his mouth. Down again
I sat. However, I immediately made up my mind, though,
of course, not knowing how many prizes I had won, to
stand up every time and sit down as soon as that old word
&#8220;Forfeited&#8221; came along, which actually happened about
four times.</p>
<p>I often wonder now how I really did look on that
celebrated occasion. But I remember making up my mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
there and then that I would remain in that school for one
year more, but no more, even if I was forced to leave
the country, and to win every prize I could that next year,
and make sure, as the Irishman says, that they would not
be &#8220;forfeited.&#8221; So I remained another year. I was fortunate
enough to win the prizes&mdash;I even won the silver
medal, special prize for religion&mdash;and it was a proud day
for me when I got them safely into my bag, which I did
as soon as possible after the ceremony, in case someone
else should come along and attempt to &#8220;<i>forfeit</i>&#8221; them. I
had taken care to order a special cab of my own and to
have my portmanteau close to the front door, so that I
could get away at the very earliest opportunity to Windsor
Station.</p>
<p>But I had not forgotten that I had made up my mind
to leave the school then, so on my arrival at home I duly
informed my venerable father that I had made up my mind
to be a soldier, and that as I was then over 17, and as
candidates for the Woolwich Academy were not admitted
after reaching their eighteenth birthday, it was necessary
that I should leave school at once and go to a crammer.
My father made no objection at all, but he said, &#8220;As your
time is so short to prepare, we will at once go back to
London and get a tutor.&#8221; Considering this was the
first day of my well-earned holidays, it was rather rough;
but I was adamant about not returning to school, so turned
southwards with my few goods and chattels, except my
much-cherished prizes, which I left with the family, and
proceeded to London on the next day.</p>
<p>So I lost my holidays, but I got my way.</p>
<p>My father selected a man called Wolfram, who up to
that time had been master at several old-fashioned
crammers&#8217;, but was anxious to start an establishment of
his own, and I became his first pupil at Blackheath. As
I had practically only some five months odd to prepare
for the only examination that would be held before I
reached my eighteenth birthday, I entered into an agreement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
with Mr. Wolfram that I would work as hard as
ever he liked, and for as many hours as he wished, from
each Monday morning till each Saturday at noon, and
that from that hour till Sunday night I meant to enjoy
myself and have a complete rest, so as to be quite fresh to
tackle the next week&#8217;s work. This compact was carried
out and worked admirably, at any rate from my point
of view. All went quite satisfactorily, for when the results
of the examination were published I had come out twenty-second
on the list out of some seventeen hundred candidates,
and as there were thirty-three vacancies to be filled,
I was amongst the fortunate ones. As I had found it so
difficult to learn the English language, I was surprised
that I practically received full marks in that subject.</p>
<p>There was generally an interval of six weeks from the
time when the actual examination was completed till the
publication of the results. The examination took place
late in the year, and as my people generally went to Spain
for the winter, they decided to take me with them, which
pleased me immensely. We arrived back at Jeréz, which
I had not seen since our departure from there in the family
train some seven years before, and, considering myself
quite a grown-up young man, I looked forward to a lot
of fun. The journey took some time. We stayed in Paris,
Bayonne, Madrid, and finally reached Jeréz. The Carlist
War had then been going on for three or four years (of
this more anon), and caused us much delay in that part
of the journey which took us across the Pyrenees, as the
railways had been destroyed.</p>
<p>By the time we arrived in Jeréz some five weeks had
elapsed, with the result that, a very few days after our
arrival, just as I was beginning to enjoy myself thoroughly,
a telegram arrived from the War Office, notifying
me that I had been one of the successful candidates at the
recent examinations and that I was to report myself at
Woolwich in ten days&#8217; time.</p>
<p>This telegram arrived one evening when a masked ball
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
was being held at one of the Casinos. Being carnival
time, it was the custom at these balls for the ladies to go
masked, but not so the men. This was a source of much
amusement to all, as the women were able to know who
their partners were and chaff them at pleasure, while the
men had all their time cut out to recognize the gay
deceivers. At the beginning of the ball I had seen a
masked lady who appeared to me just perfection. She
was sylph-like; her figure was slight, of medium height,
feet as perfect as Spanish women&#8217;s feet can be; a head
whose shape rivalled those of Murillo&#8217;s angels, blue-black
tresses adorning it, and eyes&mdash;oh! what eyes&mdash;looking at
you through the openings in the mask. I lost no time
in asking her to dance. I did not expect she would know
who I was, but <i>she</i> lost no time in saying &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and
round we went. I found I didn&#8217;t like to leave her, so I
asked her to dance again&mdash;and again. She was sweetness
itself. She always said &#8220;Yes.&#8221; It was in the middle of
this that I was informed by my father of the telegram to
return to Woolwich. I wished Woolwich in a very hot
place. Soon came the time for the ladies to unmask. She
did so, and I beheld, in front of me, a married aunt of
mine! Going back to Woolwich didn&#8217;t then appear to
me so hard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>A FRONTIER INCIDENT</h3>
</div>

<p>I was finishing my second term at Woolwich and the
Christmas holidays were close at hand.</p>
<p>I had, during the term, been closely following the
fortunes of Don Carlos and his army in the northern provinces
of Spain. Year after year he had been getting a
stronger and stronger hold, and the weakness of the Republican
Governments in Madrid had assisted him very
materially. There was no one&mdash;had been no one&mdash;for
some years to lead the then so-called Government troops
to any military advantage in the field against him.</p>
<p>General Prim, the Warwick of Spain, had been assassinated
in Madrid. The Italian Prince, Asmodeus, to
whom he had offered the Crown and who for just over a
year had reigned as King of Spain, was glad to make
himself scarce by quietly disappearing over the borders to
Portugal. A further period of Republican Government
was imposed upon the country, equally as inefficient as it
had been before. The star of the Carlist Cause seemed
to be in the ascendant. Never&mdash;up to that date&mdash;had Don
Carlos&#8217;s army been so numerous or better equipped. The
Carlist factories were turning out their own guns and
munitions. They held excellent positions from which to
strike southwards towards Madrid, and on which to fall
back for protection if necessary.</p>
<p>Everything pointed to a successful issue of their enterprise,
backed up as it was by the Church of Rome, and
tired and worn out as the country was by successive revolutions,
mutinies of troops, unstable Governments and
hopeless bankruptcy. So I thought my chance had come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
to see some fighting of real ding-dong nature by paying
Don Carlos a personal visit. Not that I thought my military
qualifications, attained by a few months&#8217; residence at
the &#8220;Shop&#8221; as a cadet, in any way qualified me to be of
any real military value to Don Carlos, but rather because
I thought that Don Carlos&#8217;s experience, after several years
of the waging of war, would be of some considerable value
to myself. Thus it came about that I decided to spend the
forthcoming Christmas holidays attached to his army,
being satisfied that I should be welcome, for I had a first
cousin and two other relations who had been A.D.C.&#8217;s to
Don Carlos from the beginning of the campaign.</p>
<p>I duly made application to our Governor at the &#8220;Shop,&#8221;
General Sir Lintorn Simmons, R.E., for permission to
proceed to Spain during the holidays and be accredited
as an English officer. This, of course, was refused, as I
was not an officer, only a cadet, and fairly young at that.
But I was told that if I chose to proceed to Spain on my
own responsibility I was at liberty to do so, provided I
returned to Woolwich on the date at which the new term
began.</p>
<p>I have my doubts whether any young fellow of eighteen
ever felt so elated, so important, so contented as I did
on my journey from London to Bayonne. As I had my
British passport I did not feel in the least concerned as
to not being allowed to cross the frontier, which happened
to be at the time in the hands of the Government troops,
into Spain. The railways in the north of Spain had
practically ceased to exist. The journey was made along
the old roads in every kind of coach that had been on the
road previous to the construction of the railways across
the Pyrenees. One particular coach I travelled in was
practically a box on four wheels, with a very narrow seat
running on each side, and very low in the roof. Going
downhill the horses&mdash;such as they were&mdash;went as fast as
they could, and every time we struck a hole in the road
down went the box, up we banged our heads against the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
roof, and then we collapsed quietly on to the floor, beautifully
mixed up.</p>
<p>This little affair happened often, and it was made
especially interesting by the fact that we had two apparently
youthful lady travellers. They had started with us
from Bayonne. They were very quietly dressed, and&mdash;so
far as we could see, through the extremely thick veils which
they wore about their heads, and from occasional ringlets
of hair peeping out here and there&mdash;they were quite the
type of the dark Spanish beauties. They had chosen the
two innermost seats inside the coach, and I happened to
occupy the seat on one side next to one of them.</p>
<p>In those days cigarette-smoking by ladies was quite
uncommon, much less was the smell of a strong cigar
acceptable to them. However, the journey from Bayonne
to the border was somewhat long. I wanted a smoke. I
had a cigar. I politely asked the ladies whether they
objected to my lighting up. They did not speak, but they&mdash;as
it seemed to me&mdash;gracefully nodded &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So I
lit up, and presently I began to notice that the one next
to me, towards whose face the smoke sometimes drifted,
seemed to like it very much, and, I would almost have said
that she was trying to sniff some of it herself. A little
later on, when we came to an unusually big rut in the
road, we all went up as usual against the roof, and all
came down again, missing the narrow seat. Extracting
ourselves from our awkward positions, I came across a foot
which certainly seemed to me not to belong to a lady, but,
as it happened, it <i>was</i> a foot belonging to one of the ladies.
I began to think but said nothing, and I also began to
watch and look. Their hands had woollen gloves on, very
thick, so that it was difficult to say what the hand was like
inside. I may say that the three other passengers were
Frenchmen, two of whom were very young and apparently
unable to speak Spanish. As we were nearing the frontier
I spoke to the ladies on some trivial matter, and mentioned
the fact that I was going into Spain and that I hoped to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
see something of the fighting; that I was an Englishman,
but that I had been born in Spain and that I knew personally
Don Carlos and several of his officers, as well as many
officers belonging to the Government troops. I noticed
them interchanging looks as I told them my story, and
presently we pulled up by the roadside at a little inn on the
French side of the frontier. We were to wait there for
some little time while the horses were changed, and we
were glad to get out and stretch our limbs after our bumping
experiences.</p>
<p>I watched them getting out of the coach, and it was
quite evident to me that, considering they were ladies, they
were blessed, each of them, with a very useful, handsome
pair of understandings. I went inside the little inn, which
boasted only, as far as I could see, one little room besides
the big kitchen, and was having some tea when one of the
ladies came into the room and, to my surprise, closed the
door, put her back against it and said, &#8220;Will you promise
not to give us away if we confide in you?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Certainly.
I am not old enough yet to have given any ladies
away, and I am not going to begin just now; so tell me
anything you like. If I can help you I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an answer her woollen gloves were whipped off,
her hands, which were a very healthy brown colour, went
up to her face, and&mdash;quite in a very awkward manner for
a lady&mdash;she battled with her veil. Up it went, finally.
A very, very clean-shaved face, but showing that very
dark complexion which many black-bearded men have, no
matter how very, very cleanly they shave, was looking
right at me. There was no need for much further explanation.
He told me that she and her companion were two
Carlist officers who were hoping to join their regiments
but had to cross the belt of the Government troops to do
so, and had decided to disguise themselves as women and
take the risk. I suggested that the other lady should be
asked to come in and hold a council of war. I told them
that I myself was going to Don Carlos&#8217;s headquarters as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
soon as I got the opportunity, and that the only trouble
I foresaw was in dealing with the sentries and the guard at
the frontier. Once past that it would be easy enough for
them to get away unmolested. My next question was,
&#8220;How much money have you ladies got? We all know
the Spanish sentries, and I think their hands are always
ready to receive some little douceur. There is but little
luggage to be examined by them. If you two ladies
remain inside the coach and be careful to cover your feet
up, I&#8217;ll keep them employed as far as possible in overhauling
the luggage. I&#8217;ll square, as far as I can, the
driver not to leave his box, but to be ready to start as
quick as I tell him to, and, by generous application of
douceurs, I&#8217;ll try to so interest the guards that they will
have but little time to make any inquiries as regards your
two selves.&#8221; All went well. We got to the frontier, the
commandant of the guard and the sentries were so taken
up in counting the tips I gave them and dividing them
equitably amongst themselves that they neither examined
the luggage nor did they even look inside the coach. I
hustled the three Frenchmen into the coach, after telling
them that it was very, very important that we should proceed
at once, shouted to the driver, &#8220;Anda, amigo&mdash;corre!&#8221;
with the result that the horses jumped off at a bound, and
I just managed to throw myself into the inside of the
coach, very nearly reaching the ample laps of my two
delicate lady friends.</p>
<p>The next day we arrived without incident at a small
village, somewhat north of Elisondo, which village was
then in the hands of the Carlists. Here my two lady
friends changed their sex, and we passed a very pleasant
evening with the Mayor of the town, who had been able
for some months previously, to be a Republican of the
most determined character while the town was occupied
by the Government troops, and to be a Carlist, second to
none in his enthusiasm for the Carlist cause, as soon as
the Carlist troops took possession of it again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>FIRST WAR EXPERIENCE</h3>
</div>

<p>I arrived at the headquarters of the Carlist Army, the
stronghold of Estella, about the middle of January, 1875.
Estella had been the seat of Government of the first Don
Carlos in the earlier war.</p>
<p>On December 31, 1874, young Alfonso had been proclaimed
King of Spain. His accession to the throne had
taken place earlier than the Civil Government, then in
power in Madrid, had intended. Its members were
Royalists, and were preparing the way for the restoration
of Alfonso to the throne, but were not anxious to hasten
it until their plans were matured. Sagasta was their Civil
Head; Bodega, Minister for War; Primo de Rivera,
Captain-General of New Castile, all powerful with the
soldiers then under his command. The man who forced
their hands was General Martinez Campos, a junior
general. A mile outside a place called Murviedro he
harangued 2,000 officers and soldiers, then camped there,
on December 24, 1874. The officers were already known
to him as favourable to Alfonso. They applauded him
enthusiastically, the men followed, and they there and
then swore &#8220;to defend with the last drop of their blood
the flag raised in face of the misfortunes of their country
as a happy omen of redemption, peace and happiness.&#8221;
(December 24, 1874.) The fat was in the fire. Those who
were delaying the Pronunciamento had to give it their
support, however much they considered it inexpedient.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Army in the Field,
Jovellar, and his Chief of the Staff, Arcaguarra, were also
Royalists at heart. Jovellar hastened to instruct his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
generals openly to acknowledge Alfonso as their King, as
King of Spain.</p>
<p>One general, the Marquis del Castillo, was then commanding
the Government troops in Valencia. He was a
loyalist too, but he did not think it right to assist with the
troops under his command in effecting a change of Government,
practically to take part in a rebellion while facing
the common enemy. Castillo prepared to resist the Pronunciamento
and march against the troops at Murviedro.
Jovellar frustrated his intentions and marched at the head
of his troops against him. Castillo&#8217;s officers and soldiers
fraternized with Jovellar&#8217;s troops, and Castillo was ordered
back to Madrid.</p>
<p>Alfonso XII reached Barcelona January 9, 1875.
Official functions, his entry into Madrid, the issuing of
Proclamations, fully engaged his time. But he was most
anxious to proceed north and place himself at the head
of his troops to whom he owed so much. Amongst the
Proclamations was one practically offering the Carlists
complete amnesty and the confirmation of the local privileges
of the Provinces where the Carlist cause was most
in favour. Don Carlos rejected the offer with disdain.
Alfonso then, early in February, 1875, proceeded north
to the River Ebro, reviewed some 40,000 of his best
troops and joined General Morriones.</p>
<p>Such was the political situation. The military situation
was as follows: Don Carlos&#8217;s Army numbered some
30,000 men. The provinces from which they had been fed
were becoming exhausted. On the other hand, Alfonso&#8217;s
troops numbered about twice their strength, and their
moral had been improved by the success of their Pronunciamento
and the return of some of the best leaders to
the command of groups of the Army. The Carlist mobile
forces had been much weakened in numbers by the blockade
of the old fortress of Pamplona, which had lasted a
long time.</p>
<p>Alfonso, with the Army of General Morriones, marched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
to the relief of Pamplona and successfully raised the
blockade, February 6, 1875, forcing the Carlists backwards.
The situation became most critical for the Carlists,
as another Royalist Army, under General Laserta, was on
the move to join Morriones in an attack on Estella. If
this plan had succeeded it is probable that the war would
have been finished there and then. Don Carlos, however,
succeeded in inflicting a severe defeat on Laserta and
completely upset the intentions of the Royalists. Alfonso
returned to Madrid, having been only a fortnight with the
Army. His presence was a source of embarrassment to
the High Command.</p>
<p>I was able to be present at the retreat of the Carlist
troops from the blockade of Pamplona, as well as the
capture of Puente de Reina by Morriones, the defeat of
Laserta, and other guerilla engagements. I had become
so interested in the work in hand that I had over-stayed
my leave by a very considerable period, and would either
have to return at once and take my gruelling at the hands
of our Governor at the &#8220;Shop,&#8221; or make up my mind to
join the Carlists and become a soldier of fortune. I
thought it out as best I could, and it seemed to me then
that the experiences I had gained&mdash;of perhaps the most
varied fighting that any similar campaign has supplied&mdash;might
be considered of more advantage to my career as a
soldier than a couple of extra months of mathematics,
science and lectures at Woolwich, and that if I promptly
returned and surrendered myself to the authorities I might
perhaps be pardoned. So I collected my few goods and
chattels, said good-bye to Don Carlos and my friends,
and returned home by no means feeling so elated, happy
and contented as I did on my outward journey.</p>
<p>On arriving in London I duly wrote to the Adjutant
at Woolwich, informing him that I had arrived safely in
England after my campaign in the North of Spain, and
that the next day, which happened to be Tuesday, I would
deliver myself as a prisoner, absent without leave, at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
Guard Room at 12 o&#8217;clock noon. This I did, and I was
met by the gallant Adjutant, and a guard, and was
promptly put under arrest. Some of my contemporaries
may still remember the occasion of my return. Numerous
had been the rumours about my doings. At times I was
reported dead. At other times I was rapidly being promoted
in the Carlist Army. I had also been taken prisoner
by the Government troops, tried by court-martial, and
sentenced to durance vile in the deep dungeons of some
ancient fortress. Their sympathies for me had risen to
enthusiasm or were lowered to zero, according to the
rumours of the day, but they were all glad to see me back.
Still they pitied me indeed, as they wondered amongst
themselves what my fate was now to be.</p>
<p>The preliminary investigation into my disorderly conduct
took place before the Colonel Commanding, and I
was then remanded to be dealt with by the Governor. I
was duly marched in to his august presence, under armed
escort, and, after having had the charge of being absent
without leave duly read to me, I was called upon by him
to make any statement I wished with reference to my
conduct.</p>
<p>As I have already said, I had learnt English only after
I was thirteen years of age, and on joining at Woolwich
I still spoke English with a considerable foreign accent,
which perhaps had become more marked during my recent
protracted visit to Don Carlos and his Army. I have
always noticed that when one gets excited a foreign accent
becomes more accentuated. It undoubtedly did on this
occasion, especially when I endeavoured to give a description
of some of the fighting in the course of my statement.
I even ventured to ask that I might be given a piece of
paper and a pencil to jot down the dispositions of the
opposing forces which took part in one of our biggest
fights. I had barely made the request when the Governor
stopped me and said: &#8220;Do you mean to tell me that you
have picked up a foreign accent like this during the short
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
time that you have been in Spain?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, no, sir, I have
always had it. I mean, I&#8217;ve had it ever since I learnt
English.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Lintorn looked serious when I said this. A smile
flitted across the countenances of the Colonel Commanding
and the Adjutant&mdash;and even of the escort. &#8220;When did
you learn English&mdash;and where? And where do you
come from?&#8221; &#8220;I learnt English,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;about
five years ago at the Oratory at Edgbaston, Birmingham,
and I spoke Spanish before that.&#8221; &#8220;What countryman
are you, then?&#8221; &#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, &#8220;my father is Scotch,
my mother is Irish, and I was born in Spain. I&#8217;m not
quite sure what I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time the smile turned into suppressed laughter.
General Simmons looked at me for a short instant. Then
he, too, smiled and said, &#8220;Well, I am going to let you
off. You must take your chance of getting through your
examination, considering the time you&#8217;ve lost. I let you
off because I feel that the experiences you have gained
may be of good value to you.&#8221; Turning to the Adjutant
he said, &#8220;March the prisoner out and release him. Tear
up his crime sheet.&#8221;</p>
<p>I forget now the wonderful escapes from tight corners
in the field, the glowing descriptions of the valour of the
Carlists, the number of times that Staff Officers had asked
for my advice as to the conduct of the war, and the many
other extraordinary tarradiddles that I poured, night after
night, into the willing ears of my astounded and bewildered
fellow cadets. One curiosity, however, may be mentioned.
Amongst the most energetic of Don Carlos&#8217;s officers was
his sister, Princess Mercedes, who personally commanded
a cavalry regiment for some considerable time during the
war.</p>
<p>The rest of my stay at Woolwich was uneventful. I
<i>did</i> manage to get through the examination at the end of
the term, but this was chiefly owing to the generous help
of those cadets in my term who personally coached me in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
such subjects as I had missed. A year afterwards, at the
end of the fourth term, the Royal Regiment of Artillery
was short of officers. The numbers of cadets in the A
Division leaving the &#8220;Shop&#8221; was not sufficient to fill the
vacancies. Some eight extra commissions were offered
to the fourth term cadets who were willing to forgo their
opportunities of qualifying for the Royal Engineers by
remaining for another term. A gunner was good enough
for me, and I was duly gazetted to the regiment.</p>
<p>I am just here reminded of an incident which took
place on the day on which His Royal Highness the Duke
of Cambridge attended the Academy to bestow the commissions
and present the prizes on the breaking-up day.
The Prince Imperial of France had been a cadet with us.
On that particular occasion he was presented with the
prize for equitation, of which he was very proud.
He was a good sport. He was very keen on fencing,
but he had been taught on the French lines, and, as the
French system was different from our English system he
did not enter his name for the fencing prize. But he said
that he <i>would</i> like to have a go with the foils against the
winner of the prize. I had happened to win it. The little
encounter was arranged as an interlude in the athletic
exhibition forming part of the day&#8217;s function. We
masked. We met. I was just starting to do the ceremonial
fencing salute which generally preceded the actual
hostilities, when he came to the engage, lunged, and had
it not been for the button of the enemy&#8217;s foil and my
leather jacket, there would have been short shrift for
J. M. G. He quickly called &#8220;One to me.&#8221; Then I
quickly lunged, got home, and called out, &#8220;One to me.&#8221;
Next instant we both lunged again, with equal results.
We would have finished each other&#8217;s earthly career if
there had been no buttons and no leather jackets. The
referee sharply called &#8220;Dead heat. All over.&#8221; We shook
hands in the usual amicable way and had a good laugh
over the bout.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>We parted on that occasion on our different roads in
life&mdash;he shortly afterwards to meet his untimely end in
the wilds of South Africa. Later on I remember attending
his funeral. His death was indeed a sad blow to his
mother, the Empress Eugénie, whose hopes had been
centred on him her only son. I well remember, as a
youngster, when visiting Madrid with my mother, looking
forward to be taken to see her mother, the Countess of
Montijo, who, with my grandmother, had been lady-in-waiting
to Her Majesty Queen Christina.</p>
<p>Just lately I was at Jeréz again, when the ex-Empress
Eugénie motored from Gibraltar to Seville, accompanied
by her nephew the Duke of Alba. They stopped for
luncheon at the Hotel Cisnes. I had the honour of a
conversation with her. Her brightness and her memory
were quite unimpaired though in her ninety-fifth year.
She recollected the incident of the fencing bout at which
she had been present. Now she has passed away to her
rest.</p>
<p>Gazetted Lieutenant, Royal Artillery, March, 1876, I
was ordered to join at the Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich,
in April.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>MY MEETINGS WITH KING ALFONSO</h3>
</div>

<p>While the exiled Prince Imperial was at the Royal
Military Academy at Woolwich another exiled Royal
Prince, in the person of Alfonso XII, father of the
present King and the successful claimant in the great
Carlist struggle, who came to his own in 1875, was undergoing
training in the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.
I came to know him intimately during his stay in England
owing to the fact that the Count of Mirasol, whose sister
married my eldest brother, was his tutor and factotum.</p>
<p>I well remember what pleasure it was to me every time
Mirasol asked me to spend the week-end with Alfonso in
town. It was winter time, and one of our favourite resorts
was Maskelyne and Cook&#8217;s. We were never tired of
watching their wonderful tricks. One afternoon we went
to their theatre, the Hall of Mysteries, with two young
nephews of mine who had just come from Spain and did not
know English. One of the feats we saw was that of a man
standing on a platform leading from the stage to the back
of the audience, and then rising when the lights were
lowered towards the roof of the building. The audience
were warned to keep quiet and still while this wonderful
act took place. One of my young nephews, who had not
understood the warning given, happened to be next the
platform. When the lights were lowered and the man
started on his aerial flight, my young nephew took my
walking stick and struck the uprising figure. The lights
went up and we were requested to leave the theatre.
Alfonso protested, but Mirasol assured him that discretion
was the best part of valour.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>On the evening of December 30, I think, I was invited
to dinner by Mirasol at Brown&#8217;s Hotel, Dover Street. I was
surprised that the dinner-hour had been fixed at a quarter-past
six p.m. I wondered where we were going afterwards.
Was it a theatre, or was it one of those quiet but
most enjoyable little dinners and dances which Alfonso&#8217;s
friends arranged for him? In addition to the large
number of wealthy Spaniards then living in London, many
families whose sympathies had bound them to the monarchical
cause had left Spain during the Republican
<i>régime</i> and made London their home. I noticed when I
arrived that Alfonso and Mirasol were in ordinary day
dress. I again wondered how we were to finish up the
evening.</p>
<p>It was at dinner that Mirasol said to me, &#8220;José Maria,
you are in the presence of the King of Spain.&#8221; I rose
and bowed to His Majesty. He stood up and, taking both
my hands in his, said, &#8220;At last I have attained my throne.
To-night I leave for Paris. My country wants me for its
king. You, José Maria, my friend, are the first in England
to be told the good news. I want you, my friend,
to wish me &#8216;todas felicidades&#8217; (all happiness). We leave
to-night. To-morrow my Army will proclaim me King
of Spain. Welcomed by the Army and the Civil Government,
I will be received at Barcelona with the acclamations
of my subjects, and thence to my capital, Madrid. To
the members of your mother&#8217;s family who, during the sad
years of my exile have so zealously devoted themselves to
my cause, I owe a deep debt of gratitude which I shall
never forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>I then told Alfonso that I had leave to go to Spain,
my wish being to see the fighting and to be in it; but that,
quite in ignorance of the fact that his succession to the
throne was imminent, I had arranged to attach myself
to Don Carlos, as my cousins on my father&#8217;s side were
with him. &#8220;Go, by all means,&#8221; said Alfonso; &#8220;I know
well that your father&#8217;s family have been zealous supporters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
of Don Carlos&#8217;s cause. My country has been rent for
years by the devotion of our people whose sympathies
have been divided between Don Carlos and myself.
Please God I may be able to unite them for the future
welfare of Spain. My first act as King of Spain will be
to offer a complete amnesty to all and one who cease their
enmity to myself and my Government and are willing to
assist me in establishing law and order and ensuring the
happiness and prosperity of my countrymen, of our
glorious Spain. Go to Carlos, certainly, but in case you
wish to leave him and get some experience of our loyalist
soldiers, Mirasol will give you a letter now, which I will
sign, and which will make you a welcome guest of any
of my generals. Good-bye. Come and see me, if you
have time, in Spain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mirasol gave me the letter and, with it in my pocket,
I felt more than satisfied that I had the chance of my life,
a chance given to few men to be a welcome guest in the
field of battle of two opponents, one a king, the other one
who, for long years, had striven hard to be a king.</p>
<p>The carriage was waiting and we left Brown&#8217;s Hotel
for Charing Cross Station. Next day, December 31, 1874,
Alfonso was proclaimed King of Spain. He landed at
Barcelona on January 9, 1875.</p>
<p>For just a moment let me tell of Mirasol&#8217;s sad end.
For some time after Alfonso&#8217;s restoration to the throne
mutinies of soldiers and civil disturbances occurred
throughout Spain. One of these mutinies took place in
the Artillery Barracks in Madrid. Mirasol was an
Artillery officer, and after the Coronation of Alfonso had
again taken up his regimental duties. He received a
message at his home one morning that the men at the
barracks had mutinied. He started at once to the barracks,
telling his wife not to be anxious and by no means to leave
the house till his return. As he was approaching the
barracks he was met by some of the mutineers. They
stabbed him to death on the pavement. His wife had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
paid heed to his request. She waited for a little time,
and could not resist her desire to follow him in spite of
his advice. As she was nearing the entrance to the
barracks she met a crowd. She asked what was happening.
A bystander said, &#8220;The mutineers have just murdered
the Count of Mirasol. There he lies.&#8221; Poor
woman. Sad world, indeed.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>WITH DON CARLOS AGAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>When I left Don Carlos in Spain after my visit to his
Army I little thought that we were again to come into
close touch and I was to spend much time with him and
my cousin, Pepe Ponce de Leon, his A.D.C. It was a
few days after I had received my commission and I was
enjoying my leave previous to joining up at Woolwich in
April (1876), when (I think it was the morning of March 8)
I received a telegram from the War Office asking me to
call there as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As, for the next four or five months, I was a great deal
with Don Carlos in London and in France, I think it will
be of interest to my readers if I describe shortly the
validity, or otherwise, of his claim to the throne of Spain.
Ferdinand VII of Spain, when an old man, married in
1830 Dona Maria Cristina, a young girl, sister of Dona
Carlota, wife of his brother, Francisco de Paula. Cristina
was not only young but also clever and beautiful. Contrary
to expectation, it was announced later on that the
Queen was about to become a mother. If the expected
child was a son, then of course that son would be the heir
to the throne. If it was a daughter, the question of her
right to the succession would arise! In 1713 Philip V
had applied the Salic Law; Carlos IV had repealed it in
1789. Now Don Carlos, brother of Ferdinand VII, had
been born in 1788 and therefore claimed the succession in
case his brother Ferdinand died without male issue. On
October 10, 1830, Cristina gave birth to a girl, the Infanta
Isabella. In March of that same year Ferdinand had
made a will bequeathing the Crown of Spain to the child
about to be born, whether male or female.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>Ferdinand, who had become very ill, fell again under
the influence of the clerics and of the supporters of his
brother, Don Carlos, who induced him to revoke his will.
However, to the surprise of everybody, Ferdinand recovered,
and under the direct influence of Dona Carlota,
Cristina&#8217;s sister, he tore up the document and, before a
representative assembly of his Ministers of State, swore
that he had repealed his will only under direct pressure
while sick to death. Ferdinand&#8217;s illness had become so
severe that Cristina was appointed Regent, and acted as
such till January 4, 1833, when Ferdinand recovered. On
June 20, 1833, Ferdinand, still most anxious to secure the
throne to his offspring, whether male or female, convened
a Cortes at Madrid which confirmed his wishes. On
September 29 he died. Cristina became Regent and the
Infanta Isabella Queen of Spain. Don Carlos refused to
recognize Isabella&#8217;s rights to the throne. The enactments
of Philip V and Ferdinand&mdash;no matter by whom made&mdash;could
not affect his own divine rights, as all such enactments
had been given effect to after he himself was born.</p>
<p>I must admit that it appears to be most difficult to
convince the direct descendants of Don Carlos that they
have not been deprived of their just rights. My readers
are at full liberty to decide this difficult problem. This
does not matter to us, it is an interesting episode in the
history of one of the oldest reigning families, the Bourbons.
The first formidable rising took place at about November
14, 1833. Estella became the seat of Government of Don
Carlos during the war, which lasted till the middle of the
year 1840. Our Don Carlos was the son of his grandfather&#8217;s
third son, Juan.</p>

<p>If you remember, I had left Don Carlos shortly after
he had frustrated Alfonso&#8217;s plans early in 1875 by the
decisive defeat of the Royalist Army under General
Laserta. The success he achieved there did not prove of
much value, in spite of the fact that the Royalist Army
were very slow in reorganizing. The result of King
Alfonso&#8217;s accession caused many of the supporters of Don
Carlos, who were fighting chiefly against the Republic,
to become lukewarm. The war continued to drag on.
Finally, weakened by the desertion of some of his chief
supporters and the recantation of the famous Cabrera, and
being completely outnumbered by the Royalist forces, Don
Carlos, accompanied by a few of his staunchest friends and
one battalion of men from Castile, crossed over the border
into France. The second Carlist war was over February 29,
1876.</p>
<p>As they had been decreed rebels, the French Government
of the day refused Don Carlos and his officers permission
to remain in France. They were, however,
allowed to proceed to England, provided no halt took
place on the way. Don Carlos notified the British Government
of his intended arrival in England, hoping he would
receive the requisite permission to proceed thither. It was
the receipt of this telegram from Don Carlos that was the
cause of my being sent for by the War Office early in
March, 1876.</p>
<p>On my calling at the War Office on receipt of their wire
the Military Secretary informed me that it was expected
that Don Carlos, accompanied by several officers, might
arrive at any time in London, and instructed me to make
all the necessary arrangements for his comfort and welfare.
Soon after receiving these instructions I got a further
telegram advising me that Don Carlos would arrive that
very same evening at about 8 p.m. at Charing Cross
Station, and further, that he and his party would actually
arrive in the very clothes in which they had left the
field of battle, for they had had no time or opportunity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
to obtain any personal effects during their flight through
France.</p>
<p>It was then that my mind took me back to Brown&#8217;s
Hotel and Mr. Ford, its proprietor, at which hotel King
Alfonso had often stayed, and Mr. Ford promised me to
arrange to put up Don Carlos and his suite. My next
business was to call upon tailors, hosiers, hatters and bootmakers
in Bond Street, and to arrange for them to have
their representatives at the hotel that evening to receive
their orders.</p>
<p>I was at the station at the appointed time, and the
travel-stained party, in their picturesque Carlist uniforms,
arrived. I can well remember the impression that they
made on their arrival. Such of the public as happened to
be present looked on in silent wonder at the group of
foreign officers. The rumour soon spread that the tall,
commanding figure, erect and distinguished, whose handsome
face and black beard were surmounted by the Carlist
headgear, the &#8220;Boyna,&#8221; was the celebrated Don Carlos
himself, of whom some of them had heard as a great leader
and who was now seeking refuge in England. We were
not long in reaching our carriages&mdash;there was no luggage
to cause us any delay&mdash;and we were glad to arrive at
Brown&#8217;s Hotel and sit down to the good dinner that
awaited us.</p>
<p>The tradesmen who attended to the personal wants of
our guests worked wonders, and, in a very few days, the
visitors were all provided with complete outfits. Many
thoughts went through my mind in those few days.
Within a year I had been the companion of a young
prince, whose mother had practically been expelled from
her throne and who had himself been exiled from his
country; a young prince who, for some years, had been
full of hopes of succeeding to the Crown and whose hopes
had seemed always to be difficult of fulfilment and not
likely to be realized. Yet he was now King. On the
other hand, the man who had fought for that throne and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
had almost succeeded in attaining it was taking refuge, not
only in the same country and city, but also in the same
hotel where his successful antagonist had spent the last
hours of his exile. The ways of Providence are certainly
wonderful.</p>
<p>As a result of diplomatic communications, Don Carlos
and those with him were permitted to reside in England
until arrangements could be made for their return to
France. At his request permission was granted me to
be attached to his Staff during his stay. He was naturally
very much run after by lion-hunters, and many were the
entertainments that were given in his honour. But the
hours he enjoyed best were those which he spent amongst
his old supporters, not only those whose homes were in
London and in the country, but also those who, after his
refusal to accept the amnesty offered by Alfonso, had been
compelled to leave Spain and take refuge in England.
There were some seventeen thousand families then expelled
from Spain. My days were fully occupied in making all
the arrangements for visiting in the country, dinners, balls,
theatre parties. In fact, it was a constant round of
pleasure and amusement.</p>
<p>The visitors&mdash;especially Don Carlos himself&mdash;were
most anxious to ride to hounds. It was a difficult matter
to mount so large a number, as the horses had to be hired,
and we all know how difficult it is to depend on hired
horses in the hunting field. Perhaps the biggest problem
was to find a horse suitable to Don Carlos. He stood six-foot
three and must have ridden somewhere over sixteen
stone. I was despairing of success when I mentioned my
difficulty to Mr. Ford. He at once relieved me of all
anxiety. He told me he thought he could mount Don
Carlos and two or three of the others out of his own private
stables. It was a right jolly good day we had. There
was to be a meet of Sir Robert Harvey&#8217;s Harriers somewhere
in the neighbourhood of Staines, I think, and Mr.
Ford kindly arranged all the details. The party returned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
home more than satisfied with the day&#8217;s sport. So time
passed, only too quickly, and the day came for their
departure. We said good-bye, and I went back to duty.</p>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 310px;'>
<b>DON CARLOS</b><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Some three months later I was agreeably surprised to
receive an official letter stating that Don Carlos had written
from Paris expressing the wish, if it could be granted,
that, as some recompense for all the trouble and, as he
put it, hard work, that had fallen to my lot while looking
after him during his stay in London, I might be allowed
a month&#8217;s leave to stay with him in Paris. The official
letter notified me that the necessary leave had been
granted. Once again I was crossing the Channel, full of
contentment, as in the days when I left Woolwich to join
him in Spain. But my hopes were very much brighter.
I was not going to see battles fought or undergo hardships.
No; I was going to enjoy myself thoroughly.</p>
<p>On arrival in Paris I met my cousin, Pepe Ponce de
Leon, the aide-de-camp referred to before. He had,
shortly after his return to Paris from England, married a
very rich widow, whose husband had been one of Don
Carlos&#8217;s principal supporters. They had a beautiful and
magnificent house in the Champs Elysées, which, as a
matter of fact, became the headquarters of the Carlist supporters
in Paris, and Pepe had arranged that it should be
my home during my stay. Life indeed was worth living
in those days. Every luxury that one could wish for was
at hand, and perhaps the most enjoyable one was the
splendid stud of horses, harness and riding, which my
cousin had got together.</p>
<p>Our usual routine was as follows: <i>Déjeuner</i> was served
at noon, at which Don Carlos generally was present and
as many of his late officers and supporters as cared to
come. These <i>déjeuners</i> were full of interest, party affairs
being discussed, but often also full of conviviality notwithstanding
the evil fortunes which had fallen upon the cause.
Later on in the afternoon riding and driving parties were
arranged for. In the evening banquets or private dinner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
parties were the order of the day, after which we all made
our own plans to amuse ourselves. Paris was very gay
and we generally managed to foregather again at midnight,
or thereabouts, for supper at one or other of the many
cafés, where music and dancing would be enjoyed. I soon
discovered that some of our intimate friends were in the
habit, instead of proceeding home to their beds after
supper, of visiting the Turkish baths. After enjoying the
bath they would sleep until the carriages arrived, and then,
after partaking of chocolate or coffee, as they desired, they
would be driven off home to sleep again until the time to
appear at <i>déjeuner</i> should arrive once more. And so the
days and nights passed, and enough for the day was the
pleasure thereof.</p>
<p>It was about this time that a reconciliation took place
between King Alfonso&#8217;s mother, Queen Isabella, and Don
Carlos, of a personal but not official character. The proverb,
&#8220;Blood is thicker than water,&#8221; sometimes comes true.
The two were near relations. They had no personal
quarrels. Her own destiny was settled and Don Carlos&#8217;s
own efforts to wrest the Crown from her son had ended in
failure. Why, therefore, any need for further enmity?
I am reminded of a quaint conceit of Isabella&#8217;s, which
amused not only her but also her friends. Isabella had
grown to be a woman of large proportions&mdash;in fact, of
unmistakable proportions. One of her favourite ladies-in-waiting
was similarly endowed by nature, if not more so.
Isabella&#8217;s hospitality was noted for its old magnificence.
Her entertainments were, one might say, superb. She
delighted in masked balls, and it was her pleasure to move
in the crowd of guests, masked, without being recognized.
As her wish in this was made known to her guests, the
pleasing illusion was kept up till the hour for unmasking
arrived.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>MY FIRST ENGAGEMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>I had been in Paris about three weeks when it came to
the mind of Don Carlos that he could arrange an excellent
marriage for me. Any of my readers who know how
marriages are managed in France and Spain could not be
surprised that his liking for me personally prompted this
kind thought. Without my knowledge, but with the aid
of my cousin&#8217;s wife and other feminine confederates, he
had selected a charming girl, some seventeen years of
age, the only daughter of a rich financier, scion of an old
French family, whose wife was a Spaniard. During my
visit I had met her at times. She was as desirable a partner
for life as any, prince or peasant, could have wanted.
Educated in one of the best convents in Paris, she spoke
English and Spanish equally as well as her own language.
She was tall, for a Frenchwoman, and her love for sport
was equal to her personal charms. Up to this time I had,
I suppose, not had time to fall in love with anyone in
particular. This was probably due to the fact that I was
imbued somewhat with the spirit which prompted a
Spanish songster to write:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style=' margin-left:2em;'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Me gustan todas,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.367917586460633em;'>Me gustan todas en general.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Then came the day when I was told that practically my
engagement to her had been approved by her family.
This came, I need hardly say, as a considerable surprise.
The future was as rosy as the rosiest sunrise in any part
of the world could be&mdash;a most desirable and charming wife,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
a life of contentment and pleasure. Who could ask for
a better future? No more soldiering. On the contrary,
a ready-made road to success, in whatever walk of life I
chose to pursue. Some such thoughts&mdash;and many others&mdash;passed
through my mind and I plucked up courage.
Still, my heart was not in the affair, as you will see; but
I argued to myself that, if the marriage did not finally
take place, it could mean only the breaking of a family
arrangement, which would not result in much grief or
sorrow to my <i>fiancée</i>, as she certainly could not have become
very devoted to me personally.</p>
<p>A fortnight or so passed, during which some further
family affairs were discussed, and the day was at hand
when the engagement was to be made public. Unfortunately
a stroke of ill luck overtook me the night before that
very day. It was the custom in Paris for those engaged
in the theatrical profession to hold annually an Artists&#8217;
Ball in aid of the charities supported by them. This year
the ball was to be held at the Grand Hotel. It was always
a brilliant and picturesque pageant. The companies playing
in the theatres entered the magnificent ballroom
dressed in their theatrical costumes, while others appeared
in fancy dresses. Remembering the fame for good taste,
smartness and chic of Frenchwomen, the beauty of such a
gathering is not surprising. The younger members of our
party promised ourselves a thoroughly enjoyable night,
while the elder ones looked forward to much pleasure too.
It was about half-past twelve that the guests assembled in
the ballroom to watch the arrival of the artists. Company
after company entered, amidst much applause, and took
up the position allotted to them. At a given signal the
men approached the ladies to beg for the honour of dancing
with them; it was a thoroughly Bohemian <i>fête</i>, and it was
not necessary to obtain personal introductions. One very
politely made his request of a lady for a dance. If it was
granted, all was well. If it was not granted, then a polite
bow&mdash;and all was not well.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>I had been much attracted by a very sweet and charming
actress. She appeared to me as the impersonation of
all that was lovely. Her complexion was fair, and her
hair golden&mdash;a head that Murillo would have loved to
paint. She was rather petite, but, oh dear me, what a
figure! What ankles! What sweetly moulded neck and
arms! What delicately coloured flesh! Are you surprised
that she looked all lovable? She had a companion,
differing in type, but with equally as many charms of her
own. One of my friends seemed to be much taken with
her, and we at once decided to try our fortune and beg
of them to honour us by accepting us as partners for the
opening dance. As soon as the signal was given we did
so, and, to our great joy, we obtained their permission.
No two young men were happier than we were, for one
dance followed another till supper was ready. Of course,
the fact had quite escaped my mind that, in France and
Spain, it is not usual for engaged men to dance with
other ladies than their <i>fiancée</i>&mdash;and certainly <i>outré</i> for
them to make themselves conspicuous by paying too much
attention to any ladies, especially at such public functions.
Still I continued to enjoy myself. My friend was equally
successful with his partner.</p>
<p>Before going to supper Louise (my charming companion&#8217;s
name) told me that she had another ball to attend
that night, and that, as it was then about 2 a.m., she and
her friend Estelle would take a light supper and leave
immediately afterwards. Their will was, of course, law
to us. We sent out a message by our footman for our
carriage to be ready at the exit gateway in half an hour,
and our <i>partie carrée</i> continued to enjoy itself. While at
supper my cousin came to our table. We introduced him
to Louise and Estelle. He joined us in a glass of champagne,
and, as he left us, he said to me in Spanish,
&#8220;Ten cuidado; tomas demasiados riesgos.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But, what
think you? Did I care? No. I did not even realize that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
he was alluding to my engagement. I just thought that
he had noticed that we four had passed the whole evening
together, and that possibly we might be opening a friendship
that might result in a liaison which might not be so
judicious. We wished him good night and he passed on.</p>
<p>After supper we hurried to our carriage and drove to
Louise&#8217;s apartments, which were only a short distance
from the Grand Hotel. Arriving there, Louise suggested
that my friend should drive Estelle home and return to
take her to the other ball to which she was going. This
we, of course, agreed to, and Louise invited me to her
apartments to have a glass of champagne while she placed
herself in the hands of her maid to change her costume and
we awaited the arrival of my friend and the carriage. They
were delightful apartments&mdash;such as one expects Parisiennes
of exquisite taste to dwell in. The dining-room
was a work of art in white and gold. Sky-blue draperies,
deeply embroidered in Japanese fashion, with birds of the
air and fishes of the seas in such bewildering colour as
only the Japanese know how to depict. Louise&#8217;s dress at
the ball was in the same sky-blue tone, and&mdash;as she stood
in her dining-room taking a glass of champagne before
handing herself over to the tender mercies of her maid&mdash;she
looked almost heavenly. Anyway, so any man would
have thought if he had been in my place, and of my age,
during those precious moments.</p>
<p>But is there not a proverb that says: &#8220;All that glitters
is not gold&#8221;? It applies not only to physical but also to
mental condition. My mental condition was one of happiness.
Louise was beautiful. Louise was kind, and the
world was good and so was the champagne. But Nemesis
was not far off.</p>
<p>Presently Louise returned to me. She wished for a
cigarette and a glass of champagne before her maid robed
her for her second ball. Just clad in the filmiest and most
fetching of wraps (I think that is the word), she looked as
bewitching as if she had just floated down from the abodes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
of bliss and beauty. She had just sipped her glass of
champagne and lit her cigarette, and leaned on the arm
of the arm-chair in which I was sitting, when we heard
the hall-door open and someone enter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; she said; &#8220;it is Gustave! Leave him to me
and say little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Louise, ma chèrie, où êtes vous?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Gustave. He drew apart the silken curtains
separating the hall from the dining-room. &#8220;Voilà, je
suis retourné. Mais ... mon Dieu!&#8221;</p>
<p>As the curtains were drawn Louise rose from the arm
of the chair (I at once rose also), and in the sweetest tones,
speaking in English, Louise said: &#8220;My dear Gustave.
What a pleasant surprise. No? Oh, yes, for me! I
thought you would not return till the day after to-morrow.
So! No? Let me introduce to you my friend, an English
officer. He has been so polite to me at our <i>fête</i>
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gustave and I stood facing each other; we had no need
for introductions. Gustave was the bachelor brother of
my prospective father-in-law. He happened also to be a
particular friend of Louise&#8217;s. I knew him and he knew
me. We looked calmly at each other. He was twice my
age; it was not for me to speak. The piece was set as if
for a dramatic scene&mdash;Louise, in her charming deshabillé;
my humble self, silent but unabashed; Gustave, practically
in possession of the situation. The moment was a critical
one, but though Nemesis had arrived it was not the Nemesis
with a flaming sword; it was the Nemesis with a somewhat
more dangerous weapon, that of French politeness,
which scorns to provoke personal quarrels in the presence
of ladies but awaits to obtain reparation in good time in
accordance with the code of honour.</p>
<p>Bowing low to Louise and looking at me straight in
the face, Gustave politely remarked, &#8220;It happens that I
am acquainted with monsieur the English lieutenant. I
regret that I have intruded and disturbed your <i>tête-à-tête</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
at such an hour of the morning. Pray forgive me, Louise.
I have no doubt monsieur the lieutenant and I will meet
by and by. N&#8217;est-ce pas, monsieur le lieutenant? Good
night to you both.&#8221; And, as Louise moved, Gustave
added, &#8220;Please, oh, please, do not bother. I know my
way out quite well. Au revoir.&#8221; He drew the curtains
aside and, turning towards us, made the politest of bows
and was gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Louise,&#8221; I said, as I took her hands in mine, &#8220;it is
all my fault. Can you forgive me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mon jeune ami,&#8221; said Louise as she looked up at me.
&#8220;First of all, give me one kiss. Yes, I like that; just one
more. So! Ah! Good! Now you said, &#8216;Forgive me.&#8217;
For that I love you, because it is what a man always
should say to a woman. I not only forgive you, but I
think you are charmant. One more kiss&mdash;eh! ah! nice.
I never allowed anyone, since I remember, even to suggest
to me to ask forgiveness. Certainly not any man. Don&#8217;t
be concerned; don&#8217;t be unhappy. Gustave will come by
and by and will ask me to forgive him for his conduct
to-night. He was rude; he was unpleasant in front of me.
He suggested, by his words, things that had not happened.
That was more than impolite; it was ungentlemanly, and
you will see he will be very sorry and come to me and
ask me to forgive him. At this moment I know not that
I will forgive him. One more kiss. He is a good friend,
but by no means indispensable to me. I have all I wish
of my own and can please myself as to whom I choose for
my friends. So don&#8217;t be concerned. Just one more kiss
and I go to make ready for the ball. Ah! the hall door
bell! Your friend returns. I will be with you bien vite.
Silence, n&#8217;est-ce pas?&#8221; And she went to her room.</p>
<p>Next minute my friend was with me. He was so full
of the charms of Estelle that I had not&mdash;even if I wished&mdash;an
opportunity of saying anything. Another cigarette,
a couple of glasses of champagne, the presence of Louise
looking sweeter than ever, all in pink silks and satins, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
we were off in the carriage to leave her at the private house
where her friends, she said, would be wondering what had
become of her.</p>
<p>We two returned home in the early hours of the morning
and retired to bed. Bed was one thing. Sleep was
another. The day and evening had been crowded with
unexpected events, wonderful happenings and newly inspired
emotions. First and foremost, one event was certain.
My engagement was doomed. Why, in all creation,
had I selected Louise from all those six hundred other
women who had attended the ball at the Grand Hotel?
Louise, who was Gustave&#8217;s friend, and Gustave, my
prospective uncle-in-law? There was only one answer&mdash;&#8220;Nemesis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I remembered my cousin&#8217;s warning at supper,
&#8220;Cuidado!&#8221; Well, warnings are of no value if they are
not heeded. One thing was clear. The engagement
would be off. I must admit that the fault was all mine;
I would not, nay, could not, offer any excuse. I had not
played the game. I had failed to rise to the occasion and
prove myself the correct youth that my sponsors had
vouched for. So, no doubt the prospective father-in-law
would soon call a family council and Gustave&#8217;s relations
would be discussed&mdash;and then, an end to the affair.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, this did not trouble me much. I
felt that the worst harm I had done was to hurt the pride
of my would-be benefactors. This might be pardonable,
but, as regarded my <i>fiancée</i>, what should I do? There
seemed to me only one way to act that was honourable.
I would ask that I might be given the privilege of seeing
her for the last time and ask her forgiveness. If this was
refused, then I would find my own way to see her. My
thoughts ran on. All the pleasures of the evening recalled
themselves. A new sensation coursed through my
brain. Yes; it must be so. I must be in love. Love at
first sight&mdash;and in love with Louise. Was she to suffer&mdash;and
I the cause of her sufferings? No. I would see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
her, tell her of my love for her, marry her. Louise, one
more kiss&mdash;eh! Then I must have fallen asleep.</p>
<p>When I returned from the world of nod my valet had
brought me my morning chocolate. My brain was anything
but clear. That some happenings of a surely
serious nature had taken place the night before was certain.
What were they? Gradually my memory recalled
them. And then I dressed. As I was just ready for
<i>déjeuner</i> my cousin sent me word that he would like to
see me. I knew what it was about. Our interview was
short. He was very kind. He laid all the blame on himself
for expecting that the method of making marriages
by arrangement would be a success where a youthful
Britisher was concerned. He, however, wished I should
tell him all that had happened since he had seen me at
supper, and especially about my meeting with Gustave.</p>
<p>I just told him&mdash;as I have told you, pointing out that
the affair had been quite harmless, though appearances
were certainly against me. He left the house and returned
later on. He had seen Gustave. The engagement,
of course, was off. My escapade was looked upon as excusable.
I was young and inexperienced in the ways of the
world, and permission was graciously given me to see my
late <i>fiancée</i>. This I did, and, I am happy to say, she not
only forgave me but we remained friends.</p>
<p>It suddenly dawned upon me that my leave was up
and that I was due back to duty at home. Don Carlos,
while somewhat resenting the unfortunate ending of his
scheme, made allowances for me when the whole story was
related to him. He smiled a kindly smile as I expressed
to him all my regrets that I had failed to take advantage
of his well-meaning efforts in my behalf.</p>
<p>But then, what about Louise? What about Gustave?
What should I do? The solution came from Gustave
himself. Next day I received an invitation from him to
a supper party at the Café d&#8217;Helder. Naturally I accepted.
We were to meet at a quarter to twelve, and my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
friend, Estelle&#8217;s admirer, was also asked. It was a merry
party; just ten of us. The hour to say &#8220;Good morning&#8221;
arrived only too soon. For me it was not only &#8220;good
morning&#8221; but also &#8220;good-bye.&#8221; I had to leave Paris the
evening of that day. My last but one good-bye was to
Louise. I kissed the hands she gave me; then she said,
looking towards Gustave with smiling eyes, &#8220;One last kiss
for monsieur the lieutenant. N&#8217;est-ce pas, Gustave?
Mais, oui. The final. Pourquoi non?&#8221; So Louise and
I kissed.</p>
<p>Then Gustave shook hands with me, placed his hand
on my shoulder, and we left the supper-room together.
He came down to see me into my carriage, and as I was
stepping into it he once more shook my hand and said,
&#8220;You are very young. I am old enough to be your father.
Always remember your English proverb: &#8216;Look before
you leap.&#8217; Good night. Bonne fortune toujours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus ended my first romance and, with it, my most
enjoyable visit to Paris.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>SOLDIERING IN IRELAND</h3>
</div>

<p>On obtaining his commission a young officer was ordered
to report himself at the Royal Artillery Barracks at
Woolwich, to undergo six months&#8217; further training in his
regimental duties and in practical work at the Arsenal,
with occasional visits to the School of Gunnery at Shoeburyness.
It was a happy six months if he managed to
keep out of trouble, for there were many temptations to
overcome. Straight away from the strict discipline of
the &#8220;Shop,&#8221; the young officer found himself&mdash;or at least
considered himself&mdash;quite a gentleman at large. In his
own opinion he had become a person of very considerable
importance, and the orders he gave had to be implicitly
obeyed. His uniform was a source of extreme pleasure to
him. He was allotted a whole &#8220;Tommy&#8221; to himself as a
soldier servant. He rejoiced in the possession of quite a
big room for his quarters. And there was the Mess.</p>
<p>At that time there had been an amalgamation of the
English and Indian Artillery, which were combined into
one General List, so that the whole of the Artillery formed
one Regiment comprising Horse, Field and Garrison
Artillery. The headquarters were at Woolwich, and the
Royal Artillery Mess was the Headquarters Mess, and is
so still, though lately there have been further sub-divisions
of the Regiment. Still, these have not as yet, so far as I
know, resulted in any change as regards the Headquarters
Mess. It remains to be seen what changes will or will not
be made in the future.</p>
<p>One of the institutions attached to the Royal Artillery
Mess was the Garrison Theatre. At regular intervals the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
Royal Artillery officers gave performances at this theatre.
Let me tell you that it is seldom that an Engineer or
Artillery officer was not a first-rate dancer; for, at the
&#8220;Shop,&#8221; two or three nights a week dancing took place
in the gymnasium to the delightful music of the Royal
Artillery band. On these nights ladies were not allowed
to attend, so the cadets had to supply the ladies amongst
themselves. But the continual practice naturally made
them good dancers. Personally I took great delight in
the art of dancing. I was built just for it, tall, light, thin
and long-legged. I was able to pirouette and high-kick
fairly well.</p>
<p>I was very keen on private theatricals, so that, amongst
my other important duties of those days, I was appointed
stage manager and producer for a week&#8217;s performance
which was to take place at the Garrison Theatre. The
play was the old farce, <i>Box and Cox</i>, which was converted
into a musical comedy. Some people say to this day
that this particular production was the origin of the
musical comedies which have since then so amused the
public. Mrs. Bouncer was most excellently performed by
Lieutenant Bingham, while Lieutenants Jocelyn and Fritz,
if I remember rightly, were Box and Cox. Mrs. Bouncer,
assisted in the musical part of the piece by a chorus of
lusty sergeants and gunners, who revelled in dances and
choruses, was a great success, while a specially selected
chorus of ballet-girls highly distinguished themselves.
The production was quite good, and the financial results
on behalf of the regimental charities were most satisfactory.
In after years the theatrical experiences thus gained gave
me considerable enjoyment. But of this, later on.</p>
<p>The end of the six months&#8217; training at Woolwich being
completed, I was appointed to a Garrison company, with
its headquarters at Limerick&mdash;good old Limerick&mdash;which
was then known as the paradise of hard-up subalterns.
Limerick is a quaint town. There is Old Limerick and
Modern Limerick. The old town is situated round the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
castle, which is on the banks of the Shannon, and
where&mdash;across the river&mdash;stands the old Treaty Stone.
It is difficult to describe Old Limerick. One must really
see it and live in it to appreciate its dirty houses, poor
tenements, its smells and other unhealthy attributes. Yet
it is a characteristic little piece of old Ireland. This part
of the old town reached down to the cathedral, past which
the main street&mdash;George Street&mdash;runs through the modern
town, practically parallel with the River Shannon. With
the exception of the old castle, Limerick does not possess
any buildings of very particular interest. The best residential
part was across the river, Circular Row. Limerick
itself has nothing to recommend it as regards picturesqueness,
but there is much beauty in the country surrounding
it. From just below the castle the River Shannon has
some beautiful reaches, right away up to Castle Connell;
while Tervoe on the river, Adare Abbey, and many other
places are well known.</p>
<p>When I reported myself to my commanding officer at
the castle I found that our company, which then consisted
of about eighty all told, was doing duty from the very
North to the South of Ireland. There was a detachment
of some twenty-five men at a place called Green Castle,
which was an old fort at the entrance of Lough Swilly,
not far off the Giant&#8217;s Causeway. Another detachment of
some thirty-five men was on duty at Carlisle Fort, one of
the forts guarding the entrance into Cork Harbour at
Queenstown. This left us about twenty men at our headquarters
at Limerick Castle. Our captain was not with
the company. He was A.D.C. to a Colonial Governor,
and, of course, was seconded. The two senior subalterns
were in command of the detachments at Green Castle
and Carlisle Fort, so that the commanding officer, our
good major and myself, were left at our headquarters with
the twenty men. By the time that we found the guard
for the day, the major&#8217;s two orderlies, my own orderly,
the cook and cook&#8217;s mate, the district gunner (who was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
busy keeping our three very old guns, mounted in the
tower, polished up), the office clerk and the barrack
sweeper, the morning parade consisted usually of the
sergeant-major.</p>
<p>At nine o&#8217;clock every morning, after first joining, I
appeared on parade, when the sergeant-major reported
&#8220;All present, sir,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Carry on, sergeant-major,&#8221;
and went inside to breakfast. After a time I&#8217;m afraid I
got into the bad habit of letting the sergeant-major come
to make his report at the window of my quarters, which
faced the barrack-square. At ten o&#8217;clock the major, whose
quarters were above mine, and who was the happy possessor
of some eight children, appeared at the company
office, and I duly reported to him, &#8220;All correct, sir, this
morning.&#8221; For it was only very occasionally that we had
a prisoner. The major would answer, &#8220;Very good.&#8221; I
would then ask him, &#8220;Do you want me any more to-day,
sir?&#8221; He would then answer, without a smile, for he
was a serious-minded major, &#8220;No, thanks.&#8221; And then the
joys of my day would begin for me.</p>
<p>The way in which my major came to be quartered in
Limerick was this. He was the eldest brother of a very
well-known family in Tipperary. He had many brothers,
all of whom were also well known and much liked throughout
the surrounding districts. They were all first-class
horsemen, and, needless to say, good sportsmen all round.
One of these brothers was at the time Sub-Sheriff of
Limerick. It was indeed a difficult post to fill in those
days. The country was exceedingly disturbed. Evictions
were all too frequent, with the accompanying result of
riots and murders, and it required much pluck and tact
to carry out the Sub-Sheriff&#8217;s duties. My major had been,
some time previous to my joining, ordered to Singapore,
while another major, a bachelor, was in command of the
company at Limerick. In those days officers were allowed
to exchange on the payment of fees agreed upon. My
major did not relish the idea of proceeding to Singapore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
with his young family of eight, so he approached the
bachelor major at Limerick with a view to an exchange,
and offered a very handsome sum. The bachelor major
very promptly accepted, and the exchange took place.
Just before leaving Limerick the members of the club gave
the bachelor major a farewell dinner, and, in proposing
his health, the chairman remarked that he didn&#8217;t understand
why anybody should wish to leave Limerick for
such an awful place as Singapore. When answering the
toast the bachelor major said he would tell them in confidence
the real reason. He went on to say that a short
time before he accepted the exchange he had been to
dinner with friends, some nine miles away, across the
Shannon, in County Clare. He was returning home with
the old jarvey on an outside car, and as it was a fairly
fine night, moonlight, and he had had a very good dinner,
he was enjoying his pipe and now and again having a
little doze. They were passing a piece of road which
was bounded on one side by a somewhat thick hedge.
Suddenly there was a flash and the loud report of a gun,
which very promptly woke him and made the old jarvey
sit up too, and pull his horse up. Immediately two
heads popped up over the hedge, had a good look at
the major, and then one of the men said, &#8220;Begorra, Pat,
we&#8217;ve shot at the wrong man again,&#8221; and promptly disappeared.
&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t you think, my friends, that it&#8217;s
time I went to Singapore?&#8221;</p>
<p>But he never told them of the cheque he got to go
to Singapore.</p>
<p>At that time the garrison of Limerick was fairly strong.
There was a Field Artillery battery at the William Street
Barracks, and there were a regiment of infantry and a
squadron of cavalry at the New Barracks, so that our
turn for any garrison duty didn&#8217;t come very often, and
we had plenty of time to enjoy ourselves. Anyone who
wished and who had sufficient horses could put in four
or five days&#8217; hunting a week during the season. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
Master of the Limerick Hounds at the time lived at
Croome. He was a typical Irish gentleman, noted for
his genial character and the forcefulness of his language
in the hunting field. Limerick is a fine hunting country,
and gives excellent sport. There were many good riders
in those days. Our friend the Sub-Sheriff was one, but
perhaps the best man there was the owner of Ballynegarde,
at whose hospitable house we spent many happy
days. He must have ridden quite over sixteen stone, and
I well remember seeing him, on a chestnut horse, clear
the wall which surrounded the park, the chestnut changing
his feet on the top, just like a cat. Good horses were just
as expensive in those days as they were before the war,
but we subalterns did not buy expensive horses; we picked
up good jumpers that had gone cronk, and trusted to the
vet., occasional firing, plenty of bandages, and not too
hard work to keep them going.</p>
<p>Riding out one morning towards Mount Shannon,
the then lovely home of the Fitzgibbons, on the banks of
the river, and just on leaving the old town of Limerick, I
arrived at a rather long and steep hill, at the foot of which
a jarvey was trying to induce his horse, a long, rakish,
Irish-built bay, to go up. The horse absolutely refused
to do so, and each time the old jarvey flogged him he
exhibited very considerable agility in every direction
except up the hill. I rode up to the jarvey and asked him
what was the matter. &#8220;Shure, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I bought
this horse to go up this hill, for I am the mail contractor
on this road. I&#8217;ve got him here these last three mornings,
and I&#8217;ve never got farther than this. Now I&#8217;ll have to go
back again and get another horse, and all the people will
get their mails late and they&#8217;ll report me, and they&#8217;ll
fine me, and the divil do I know what my ould missus&#8217;ll
have to say about it. And, shure, yer honour, &#8217;tis all the
fault of this donkey-headed old quadruped.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked him whether the old quadruped could
jump.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shure, yer honour,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he&#8217;d jump out of
his harness, traces an&#8217; all, if I hadn&#8217;t got him by
the bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you sell him?&#8221; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will I sell him?&#8221; says he. &#8220;Will I find the fool
that&#8217;ll buy him, yer honour?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring him up to the old castle in the morning,&#8221; says
I, &#8220;and I may find the fool that&#8217;ll buy him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Begorra, sir,&#8221; says he, &#8220;yer a gintleman. I&#8217;ll be
there with him at nine o&#8217;clock, with a halter round his
old ewe neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next morning, at nine o&#8217;clock, just as the sergeant-major
was reporting as usual, &#8220;All correct,&#8221; I saw my
old friend leading his quadruped into the barrack square.
He was a quaint looking horse. He was particularly full
of corners, for he wasn&#8217;t furnished up above at all. But
he had good-boned legs. His coat was by way of being
a miracle to look at. He had no particular colour to
speak of. In some places he was a bit of a roan&mdash;Taffy-like;
round some other corners he was a dirty bay. In
some places, especially where for the last three days he had
attempted to get out of his harness at the bottom of the
hill, there was no hair at all. But he had a good-looking
eye; he had good sound feet; good bone, though his
tail was hardly up to Cocker. Most of it, no doubt, was
now part and parcel of the car.</p>
<p>I can well remember the look of the correct and austere
sergeant-major&mdash;who himself was a bit of a sport, but who
still considered himself &#8220;on parade&#8221;&mdash;as he cast his eye
over that noble quadruped, and wondered what his
lieutenant was about. I could see that he was asking
himself, &#8220;Is he going to run a circus, and is this going
to be the freak horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mick,&#8221; says I, &#8220;if I get a saddle on the horse, will
you ride him; come out with me and put him over a couple
of jumps?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shure, yer honour,&#8221; says he, &#8220;an&#8217; so I will.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sergeant-major,&#8221; says I, &#8220;tell my groom to put a
saddle and bridle on this Rosinante&#8221; (at the mention of
which name the sergeant-major looked perplexed) &#8220;and
get one of the other horses ready for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few minutes Mick and I were riding down the
old street, making for a bit of open country. We soon
came to a high road, bounded on each side by fairly
stiff, stone walls. Having come to a gate on one side I
pulled up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; says I, &#8220;Mick, are you game to go into that
field and take the double across the road?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shure, I am,&#8221; says he; &#8220;but &#8217;tis a long day, yer
honour, since I had a jump. Would you lend me your
whip? The old horse&#8217;ll want it, it may be.&#8221;</p>
<p>I gave him the whip, jumped off my nag, opened the
gate, and away went Mick into the field. It was a sight
to do one good. There was Mick, what he called his hat
stuck on the back of his head, and what was left of his
coat-tails flying in the air behind him, heading for the
first stone wall, and, before you could say &#8220;knife,&#8221; he was
over it like a bird, across the road, over the wall the other
side, with a &#8220;whoop-la&#8221; that you could have heard in
the cathedral in Limerick.</p>
<p>Just as well to mention that Rosinante&#8217;s age was
what is known amongst horse-copers as &#8220;uncertain,&#8221;
that is, anywhere between nine years old and twenty-four.</p>
<p>After that (it was not long before we were again at the
Castle) I asked Mick Molloy how much he wanted for the
horse. He said, &#8220;Shure, I&#8217;ll just take what I gave for
it. He&#8217;s no good to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked him how much that was, and he said, &#8220;Five
pounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was so surprised, that he became quite apologetic,
thinking he was asking too much, and quickly began to
sing the praises of his mount. I at once disabused him
of the idea by telling him that I couldn&#8217;t give him less
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
than £7 10s., which might help him a little towards
his getting an animal that would pull his car up the hill.
The horse became mine, and the late owner left the
barracks wishing me all the blessings that our good God
and Ould Oireland could bestow on my humble head.
The end of Mick Molloy came later on.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>UNRULY TIMES IN IRELAND</h3>
</div>

<p>Affairs in Ireland have always been a source of wonderment
to me. Ever since the days I spent there, right
through to the present time, the doings&mdash;at one time or
another&mdash;of some of the inhabitants of Ireland have puzzled
most people. All the talent of all the Prime Ministers
and Members of Parliament, within these forty years, has
been unable to ensure for Ireland such political and
economic conditions as would have made it the happy
country which it ought to be.</p>
<p>When I was there in 1877-1878 the times were full of
trouble, and I recall several episodes which show the
temper of the people at that day. Some four miles from
Limerick is a place called &#8220;Woodcock Hill,&#8221; where the
rifle ranges, for the instruction in musketry of the troops
quartered there, were situated. Close to the range was a
small Catholic chapel, standing practically by itself. An
infantry regiment was quartered in Limerick at the time.
It was an English regiment; its depôt, from which the
recruits fed it, was somewhere in the North of England,
and the number of Catholic soldiers in its ranks was very
small in proportion. One Sunday morning the priest
attending the little chapel at &#8220;Woodcock Hill&#8221; found that
somebody had broken into the church and stolen some of
the altar fittings and&mdash;worse from the Catholic point of
view&mdash;had taken the chalice used at Mass. This, of
course, was nothing less than sacrilege in the eyes of the
devout Catholic Irishmen.</p>
<p>Rumours soon began to circulate that, on the previous
Saturday evening, after some rifle-shooting had taken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
place, two red-coats had been seen in the vicinity of the
chapel. These rumours were not long in being spread
throughout the city, and as the regiment was looked upon
as being anti-Catholic, reports went about to the effect
that the sacrilege had been carried out not so much for
the sake of the value of the stolen articles, but purely out
of hatred for the Catholics and for the purpose of desecrating
the holy place. The consequences of these rumours
soon became apparent. Soldiers, returning home late at
night, were set upon and hammered in the by-streets. As
a result, instead of going about in ones and twos, they
would congregate in bigger groups and took every opportunity
of retaliating on the civilians.</p>
<p>On a quiet Sunday morning, a glorious day, at about
eleven o&#8217;clock, red-coats in small groups rapidly began
to arrive at the old Castle. I had been out riding and was
returning to my quarters about twelve o&#8217;clock, and I found
that there were not less than somewhere between 150 and
200 soldiers within the barrack gates. It had been the
custom for members of other corps to come into the canteen
at the &#8220;Castle&#8221; for a glass of beer or two, after their
dismissal from church parade. But for such a number to
get together was more than unusual.</p>
<p>In the absence of the major, my commanding officer,
the responsibility of dealing with the case fell on me. I
determined to send my groom with a message to the officer
commanding the regiment at their barracks, which were
at the other end of the main street in the town, to inform
him of what was going on, and then to order the men off
in small groups from the &#8220;Castle.&#8221; But there was no time,
for hardly had I finished writing my message than the
whole lot of red-coats left the barracks together and proceeded
towards George Street. They had their waistbelts
on but fortunately did not carry any side-arms. Still, the
good old infantry belts, with their heavy brass buckles,
were quite a formidable weapon to use about in a crowd
which was unarmed. I jumped on my horse and, riding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
by side streets, reached the police station, which was in
the middle of the town, close to the main street, to inform
the police of what was taking place. However, when I
got there, it had become evident to the police that trouble
was coming, for large numbers of civilians were congregating
and showing considerable excitement in the main
street and moving down towards the cathedral from which
direction the red-coats were coming.</p>
<p>Before any steps could be taken by the police the crowd
of civilians and the red-coats met. For some little time the
red-coats made their way through the crowd, slashing
with their belts. Some stones began to fly, heavy sticks
were being used, and gradually the red-coats were separated
and were getting quite the worst of the bargain.</p>
<p>The news of the disturbance had reached the barracks
shortly after the two factions had met, and such of the
soldiers as were at that time within the barrack walls were
ordered to parade under arms, with a view of marching
down the street to restore order. However, by the time
they were ready to march out there were but few red-coats
left in the streets. They had been dispersed by the crowd
and had sought safety wherever they could. They were
collected later on and marched up to their barracks by
police and military escorts, quiet was once again restored
that Sunday afternoon, and the remains of the fight collected
in the shape of lost belts, broken shillelaghs, road
metal and smashed glass, while a good many broken heads
and bruised limbs received attention.</p>
<p>The sequel was this. The regiment was confined to
barracks until further orders. Two nights afterwards, in
the early hours of the morning, it marched quietly along
to the railway station. A troop train awaited its arrival,
while at another platform more troop trains landed another
regiment which, in equal silence, marched off to its new
quarters. So ended this episode, for as soon as, on the
next day, the townspeople became aware that the offenders,
as they considered them, had gone, they lost all resentment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
and were quite ready to make friends and to welcome their
successors, who soon were enjoying quite a time of popularity.
We soldiers always looked forward to election time
with considerable anxiety. We were generally ordered to
be ready, in case our assistance was wanted in aid of the
police, and we knew that long before we should be called
on to use our rifles or even our swords brick-bats and
other missiles would be flying about, quite indifferent as to
whom they would hit. The opposing political sides had
one great end in view, and that was to break each other&#8217;s
heads, and they deeply resented anybody else attempting
to interfere with that playful form of amusement, so that
oftentimes both sides would turn their attention on the
police and soldiers, causing us quite considerable inconvenience.
However, I must say this, that on no occasion
when I was on duty at such so-called political meetings and
elections did the situation become so aggravated as to
necessitate the use of their arms by the soldiers.</p>
<p>Still, we did go home sometimes with a sore head, and
I received my first wound from a piece of road metal hurled
at me from quite a short distance by a great, strapping,
fine Irishwoman. This occurred at Belfast some time after
the affair at Limerick. As far as I remember there was
to be a Catholic procession from somewhere near the
Customs House through the principal streets to the Catholic
cathedral. The city authorities and the police were notified
and fully expected quite high old times as regarded
street fighting. They had been advised by those who were
carrying out the procession that the Catholics fully intended
to reach the cathedral, even if it took them a week and they
had to walk over the bodies of whoever tried to stop them,
They knew whom they meant all right. The Orangemen
had also informed the authorities that they had very rooted
objections to this procession and that they were determined
that that procession was not to get to the cathedral without
some efforts of resistance on their part. Consequently the
authorities requested military assistance, and further stated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
that they thought it would be necessary to have on hand,
or close to, a sufficient number of soldiers to preserve the
peace. So the scene was set for a pretty disputation.
Many police were in attendance, and the soldiers were
principally utilized out of view, as far as possible, in the
side streets debouching on the route of the procession. It
was hoped by these means to prevent sudden rushes by
these side streets taking the procession at a disadvantage
on the flank.</p>
<p>I was detailed to take charge of a dozen cavalrymen and
was allotted my own little side street. We waited for
some three or four hours before the procession as such,
or what was left of it, seemed to be approaching our way.
It is difficult to describe the noises that filled the air up to
that time. We could not see down the main street, but
we could hear the smashing of glass windows and the
rattling of stones could be easily made out. And then
came our surprise. Suddenly our little side street became
full of men and women, rushing towards the main street,
no doubt to obtain further points of advantage. I can see
the women now, holding their petticoats up with both
hands, in which the munitions of war in the shape of road
metal were being carried, and from which the men helped
themselves as they wanted. They came straight at us.
What could twelve men do on horseback against such a
rush? They were on us, round us, through us, before we
could get our breath. I suddenly felt one of my feet had
been taken out of the stirrup-iron, and the next thing was
that I was pulled out of my saddle and fell, to my surprise,
on something comparatively soft. It happened to be a
lady who was paying me this delicate attention, and, as
I fell on her, she sat down on the ground, dropped her
petticoat out of her hand, and out fell her stock of munitions.
It was some little time before she found breath
sufficient for her to let me know just what she thought of
me for coming there to &#8220;interfere with their business.&#8221;
I must have hurt her and annoyed her, for as I got up and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
was just mounting my horse, which one of the troopers
was holding, the lady, a big strapping, fine Irishwoman,
picked herself up off the ground, seized the handiest piece
of road metal, and threw it, from about three yards away,
at the back of my head.</p>
<p>I saw nothing more of the procession that day. I heard
no more sounds of revelry. I woke up, late in the afternoon,
not in my little side-street but in a very comfortable
bed with my head duly bandaged and a nurse sitting alongside
of me. I didn&#8217;t ask why or wherefore I was there.
I felt it. All I said to her was, &#8220;One whisky and soda,
please, quick!&#8221; which she brought and which I drank,
and then she told me that it had been reported that the
tail end of the procession had reached the cathedral at
last. So all was well. I bear that honourable scar to this
day.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>SPORT IN IRELAND</h3>
</div>

<p>Roller-skating had become the fashion in England, and
three or four of us became anxious to introduce it into
Ireland. We formed a small company and appointed our
directors, whose business knowledge was about equal to
their knowledge of the art of roller-skating at that moment.
However, all went well. The rink was opened at Dublin.
A club of the nicest of the nice was formed. The members
practised very hard, day after day, and evening after evening,
with closed doors, until we became quite artists. Then
came the time to inform the public at large that the rink
would be open to them every afternoon and evening,
reserving Tuesday and Thursday nights for the members
of the club.</p>
<p>From the very jump the rink was a success. The
members of both sexes gave exhibitions. We played tennis
on roller-skates; we danced on roller-skates; we held
athletic sports on roller-skates, including steeple-chases
and obstacle races. In a very short time the public at
large became quite as good skaters as those who taught
them, if not better. Then came the usual development
that has attended similar enterprises ever since. Fancy
dress balls, gymkhanas, carnivals and such like, and&mdash;what
was more satisfactory to the company&mdash;money rolling
in all the time. The expenses were not heavy but the
dividends <i>were</i>, and, to our surprise, we members of our
company, very few in number, found ourselves absolutely
drawing a regular monthly dividend. As we were mostly
poor soldiers this was highly gratifying. I remember
investing my first dividend in buying a mate to &#8220;Mick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
Molloy.&#8221; He was much more expensive, you can guess,
and I named him, following upon the naming of Mick
Molloy, Larry O&#8217;Keefe.</p>
<p>The success of our venture in Dublin led us to thirst
for further triumphs, and, at an especial meeting of the
company in Dublin, it was decided to repeat the success
at Limerick. So it came about that the rink at Limerick
was started. We followed the same methods that had been
carried out in Dublin, only we had not to undergo the
probationary stage of learning to roller skate. A large
party arrived from Dublin, and after one week of real joy
and fun soon made the rink a success. This made us
bold, so we exploited Cork and Waterford and our
pecuniary successes increased daily, and some of us began
to think that it would be worth while to throw up our
military careers and become professional roller-skating
rink promoters. That was really my first business venture.
Others followed later on, as you will hear by and by, but
not with the same result.</p>
<p>Let me tell you now what happened to Mick Molloy.
He was certainly a good horse and a splendid jumper,
but he had one bad fault and that was that, every now
and again, apparently for no reason whatever, except the
same cussedness that held him when he wouldn&#8217;t go up
the hill, he would hit a bank or a wall full hard and turn
head over heels into the next field. As the weather, as a
rule, was moist, and there was plenty of mud about when
Mick Molloy performed his athletic feat and I picked myself
up from the soft ground, I generally succeeded in
attaching to my person a fairly considerable amount of
Irish soil. At this particular time one of the great demands
by Irishmen was for what they then called &#8220;fixity of
tenure.&#8221; Can you wonder that, after my repeated attempts
to annex as much of Irish soil as Mick Molloy could help
me to, the members of the hunt christened me &#8220;Fixity of
Tenure&#8221;?</p>
<p>I had a visit from one of the best riders in Ireland at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
that time who was quartered at the Curragh, whose riding
at Punchestown Races was always good to watch and who
had come down for a few days&#8217; stay with us. There was
a meet of the hounds; he wanted a ride. I offered him
Mick Molloy, who was in good form just then, and he
accepted the offer. I warned him of his one peculiarity.
The morning of the hunt we rode out together. It was
in the direction of Ballynegarde. There was often a trap
to be met in the way of a sunken ditch over-grown with
gorse, and unless one knew the lay of it a horse was apt
to rush through instead of jumping and find himself and
the rider at the bottom of the sunken ditch. I had forgotten
to warn the rider of Mick Molloy of this fact. We
had a fine seven-mile run in the morning and killed one
fox. My friend was delighted with Mick, for he had
carried him to the kill without a fall. He was full of
praises of old Mick.</p>
<p>The hounds had a spell and, once more, they were
thrown into covert. In a short time &#8220;Gone away&#8221; was
heard and the hounds streamed out, following a good
scent, across a beautiful piece of country. I got into difficulties
very early. Old Larry and I had a difference of
opinion about a stone wall. He wouldn&#8217;t have it at any
price. I had got out of the line and, unless I could get
over that particular wall, I was going to be out of the
run. So I made up my mind that over the wall Old Larry
must go, with the result that I got over the wall all right
but Old Larry didn&#8217;t. Not only that, but, after giving
what I thought at the time was a very impertinent sniff,
he put his head and his tail up in the air and trotted off
across the field, leaving me in full possession of the wall.
That run was over for me. Another belated huntsman
caught Old Larry and, as it was late in the afternoon and
the hounds were well out of sight, we turned our horses&#8217;
heads towards home. The hour for dinner came. It was
dark. It was raining, but neither my friend nor Mick
Molloy had turned up. We dined heartily and well, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
it was not till about ten o&#8217;clock, when the port wine was
going round merrily, that my brother officer came in.
Yes, he was wet and weary. He carried a saddle and a
bridle in his arms, but&mdash;alas! also there was no Mick
Molloy. In the second run he had come across one of
these sunken ditches. Mick Molloy rushed it, fell into it,
and the weight of his rider had broken his back. Such
was the end of good old Mick.</p>
<p>The last meet of the Limerick Hounds which was held
that season gave the opportunity to some bright members
of the club to play off a practical joke on the members of
the Hunt. If the weather was suitable after the close of
the season, and the Master so wished, a few extra meets
were arranged for by him. No regular notice was given
for such meets; the secretary of the Hunt generally informed
the members by post-card that a meet would be
held at such a place next day. This particular year April
Fools&#8217; Day was on a Tuesday. The members duly received
a post-card on the Monday that an extra meet of
the hounds would take place at a place called Tervoe, about
five miles from Limerick, on the Wednesday. Later on
in the afternoon on the same day members received telegrams
to say that the meet would take place on the
Tuesday instead of Wednesday. On Tuesday morning
members turned up and wound their ways towards Tervoe.
At the barracks we had to rearrange our plans as to who
could get away for this, perhaps the last meet of the year.
It was finally settled, and those of us who could be spared
rode off.</p>
<p>On the way to Tervoe we overtook a couple of other
members, and after riding a little distance they said, &#8220;You
fellows had better go back. This is a sell. Don&#8217;t you
know it&#8217;s April Fools&#8217; Day? Go back.&#8221; Well, we believed
them and turned back, for they told us they were
only going out to see the fun at Tervoe.</p>
<p>We were going back when we met some other members
going out, so we told them, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you go. This is all a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
sell. Don&#8217;t you know it&#8217;s April Fools&#8217; Day?&#8221; They
looked at us in surprise and said, &#8220;Well! How can you
fellows have been made fools of like this? Those two
chaps are just making April fools of you. Come along,
let&#8217;s hurry on or we&#8217;ll be late.&#8221; It was in no pleasant
mood that we trotted again towards Tervoe. We were
anxious to interview our two kind friends. Then we
arrived at the Meet to find that it was a sell all right, and
that the whole of the members of the Hunt had been sold.
We only had one satisfaction left, and that was that <i>we</i>
had been sold twice that morning instead of once.</p>
<p>I must leave dear old Ireland, pass over my stay in
Cork; the glorious days in Queenstown Harbour; how we
dropped two fourteen-ton guns, the first of their kind,
which we were to mount at Carlisle Fort, into the bottom
of the sea and how we picked them out again; the late
nights and the early mornings at the Cork and Queenstown
clubs; the beautiful girls for whom Old Ireland is so much
noted; the meetings of the South United Hunt Club at
Middleton, where the Murphys, Coppingers and other
splendid riders lived. And I must also pass over the six
weeks of what in those days appeared to me as the term
of solitary confinement right away at Greencastle Fort at
the entrance to Lough Swilly. I went up there in the
winter. Greencastle village was a small summer resort for
the people of Londonderry. There was an hotel, which
was open in the summer, and was managed by a man and
his sisters. In the winter it was shut up. A few small
cottages were also closed up. The population consisted
of the policeman and three or four fishermen.</p>
<p>There was nothing to do for the men at the fort, except
a little gun-drill. The nearest village was Moville, some
four miles off. It was too rough as a rule to go fishing
with any degree of comfort, so it was that I learnt how
to play marbles. The old policeman, a couple of the
fishermen and the hotel-keeper, when he was sober&mdash;which
was not often&mdash;were quite experts, and taught me the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
game. They called it Three-Hole. The idea was this:
you had to make nine holes, and the one who was last
in doing so had to stand drinks, and, in addition, to put
his hand down on the ground, with the knuckles facing
the others, each one of whom had three shots at him with
a good hard marble. This may be of little interest, indeed,
as far as the game is concerned, but it shows one
how different were the lives of us young officers then from
what they are nowadays.</p>
<p>After my stay at Greencastle I proceeded to take charge
of our detachment at Carlisle Fort, Queenstown Harbour.
Have you ever been there? If not, go when you get the
opportunity. Certainly Carlisle Fort itself&mdash;it lies on the
left-hand side of the exit from the harbour&mdash;is difficult to
get to. Either you had to cross by sailing-boat from
Queenstown&mdash;there were no motor launches&mdash;or else drive
right round the long arm of the harbour, at the end of
which is Rostellon Castle. In the summer either trip
was, as a rule, quite enjoyable. If one wished to go to
Queenstown or Cork, an hour or so with a fair wind would
land you at Queenstown. If, on the other hand, time was
no particular object, the drive to Middleton, the headquarters
of the hunt, was a most pleasant one. You
passed Aghada Hall, then Rostellon, farther on. You
could rest at the Sadleir Jacksons&#8217; hospitable home. But
in the winter it was not so pleasant. The hunting
country was all on the inland side of the harbour. One&#8217;s
mounts had to be sent round by Rostellon the day before
the meet. And then, if those of us quartered at Carlisle
wished to get to the meet in time, we had to make a very
early start in our garrison boat, so as to reach Queenstown
for an early breakfast at the club, and then a long drive
to the meet. Sitting in an open boat at 4 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>A.M.</span> on a dark
winter&#8217;s morning, with perhaps a head wind and four
miles of a choppy sea to battle against, required a considerable
amount of endurance and keenness, but we did
it all right. It used to strike me as an odd circumstance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
in those days that the Tommies who manned the boat
were so pleasant over the job. They were not going to
hunt. They were not out to enjoy themselves. We were.
Yet there were always volunteers, who apparently found
pleasure in helping their young officers, though at very
considerable inconvenience to themselves. But then the
right Tommy is, and always has been, a good chap.</p>
<p>It was out with the Cork South United Pack of fox-hounds
that I first met with a serious accident. I was
riding a ripping mare, which I had named Kate Dwyer,
and which, up to the day of this accident, had not given
me a fall. The hounds were running up a long gully.
The fox did not seem to have made up his mind as to
which side of the gully he would break. Some of us
thought it would be to the right, and we were following
the crest of the gully on that side. We came to a stone
wall on the slope of the hill. It was a thin wall&mdash;daylight
through it. One had only to give the stones a push to
make a very easy gap. I walked the mare up to it quietly
and was leaning forward to push the stones down with
my whip, when, I presume, the mare thought I wanted
her to move on. So she tried to make a standing jump
of it. It was a failure. She struck it and we fell together,
my right leg being crushed by her weight falling
on it on some of the displaced stones. The leg was not
broken, but the flesh and tissues were all torn below the
knee, and the bone pretty well lacerated. I was taken
to Middleton, the then home of the Murphys and the
Coppingers and many other good sportsmen, and, after
having my injuries patched up, went to hospital. The
mare, I am happy to say, had hardly even a scratch
on her. She was the best bit of horseflesh I ever threw
my legs across. I sold her afterwards to a friend from
Northumberland, who, having married an Irish girl, used
to come every year to put in a couple of months&#8217; hard
riding in Limerick. He bought her from me at the end
of the season and took her home to Northumberland. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
did well in the summer, but, on the opening day of their
season, she fell down dead in the middle of their first run.
Poor old Kate.</p>
<p>My accident proved more severe than I anticipated, and
I was sent home to Scotland on sick leave. After two
months my leg mended up and I returned to Old Ireland
in the early summer. Our company&#8217;s annual training
and the landing and mounting of the two first &#8220;Woolwich
infants&#8221;&mdash;fat, six-inch muzzle loaders&mdash;at Carlisle Fort
filled up the time till the autumn months. As I was very
keen on shooting and was given three weeks&#8217; leave, I
returned to Limerick, in the neighbourhood of which sport
was of the best. I never had anywhere in the world a
better day&#8217;s woodcock shooting than the O&#8217;Grady family
gave me in County Clare. Long narrow belts of wood
in an undulating country were full of the so-called best
sporting bird in the world. Hard to down; best to eat.
Equally good with the woodcock shooting in Clare was
the wild-duck shooting in the quaking bogs of County
Limerick, and away in the loughs, westwards, towards
the mouth of the Shannon.</p>
<p>Before proceeding further, I have to make an admission.
My readers will have no doubt have discovered by
this time that I am faithfully recording what comes to my
mind of the old days. If the incident I record tells
against me I am quite content to accept the blame. Why
not? No one really knows where the hand of fate is
leading one. Thank God we know not what to-morrow
is going to bring forth. All pleasure and zest in life
would be gone if we only knew what to-morrow was going
to do for us. Yet we have to behave to-day&mdash;or should
behave to-day&mdash;so as to secure a pleasurable and profitable
to-morrow, in case we are permitted to be alive on the
morrow. It seems to me how wonderful it is that any
act on one&#8217;s part&mdash;quite unpremeditated, or only if done
just by chance&mdash;can have so great an influence on all our
to-morrows. It may ruin all our prospects or may make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
us the happiest of mortals. It may bring the saddest of
morrows to those dearest to us, or it may shower blessing&mdash;unintentionally,
of course&mdash;on our worst enemies.</p>

</div>

<p>Well, no more sermons. What is the admission I
was going to make? Well, I will now tell you, right off.
I fell in love. Quite hopelessly, desperately in love. It
was very annoying and distressing, for had I not, up to
then, loved so many that I loved no one in particular, at
any rate, except for short periods of time. What was
coming over me, I wondered? Oh, but, whatever it was,
it was indeed sweet, and, if love is freely, wholly given,
and is returned, then is it not heavenly bliss on earth?
Yes, no doubt. But, what about to-morrow?</p>
<p>There was, unfortunately, no chance of a happy to-morrow
for us. Except our love, all else was against
us. She was young, sweet as only a real colleen can be,
her Irish blue-violet eyes set in her lovely forehead, fringing
which her glorious gold chestnut hair sparkled in the
sun with the richest tints. To watch her on horseback
was a dream. But&mdash;and now your sympathies will, I
hope, be given to me&mdash;she was married. She cared not
for her husband; her husband evidently did not particularly
love her. It was the old story. Two young
people marrying young and then discovering that they
had been too hasty and that they could not live together
happily. There was nothing new in this situation. It
seems to be always happening. I have come across such
happenings more than several times since the days I am
now writing of. The Divorce Court appears to be useful
in such cases and relieves the sufferings of those affected,
at times. But the Divorce Court cannot reach every one,
can it? There is not enough time nor are there enough
Divorce Courts to get round.</p>
<p>But let me get on with my affairs before I start a
discussion as to what love is. Let it suffice that I was
suffering from a violent attack of it. However, something
else was to claim me and set me on to fresh fields.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
Just then, as the result of the evenings and moonlight
nights spent wildfowl shooting in the bogs in the cold,
I got rheumatic fever, and once more returned to hospital.
My illness, which became very serious, led to my being
ordered the longest sea voyage I could take, in the hopes
of regaining my strength. This necessitated my resigning
my commission and taking my passage for a trip to New
Zealand, though the doctors did not seem to think I should
reach that far-off land. Thus ended my second romance.
And now for fresh worlds to conquer, if Providence only
gave me health.

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>A VOYAGE TO NEW ZEALAND</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a bright summer&#8217;s morning. Somewhere about
noon the good clipper, the New Zealand Shipping Company&#8217;s
<i>Waipa</i>, slipped her cable and was taken in
tow down the old River Thames. Her skipper was
a good sea salt; he was a Scotsman all right. His name
was Gorn. I had been allotted my cabin. I was, of
course, unable to move without help, but I did look forward
to getting better as the good old ship moved to the
south and worked into warmer tropical climes. The days
are now past to go to the other end of the world&mdash;the
farthest end, anyhow, then known&mdash;in a sailing ship.
We had three months&#8217; voyage in front of us. We were
to call nowhere; we were just to sail merrily along for
three solid months, till we reached our first port of call,
Port Chalmers, in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Our passengers were not many in what we called the
saloon&mdash;three New Zealanders, who had made money as
shepherds and then become owners of sheep stations, and
a few intending settlers in that beautiful land, retired
officers and ex-clergymen, with their families, took up the
available first-class accommodation. The remainder of
the passengers, of whom there were a good many, were
emigrants of both sexes, a happy, contented crowd, many
of whom were looking forward to the better conditions
of life which New Zealand offered them through her
commercial agents in London.</p>
<p>I well remember how soon our small troubles began.
Perhaps the only real trouble was our medical officer.
He was the doctor in charge of the ship, and was kind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
and attentive, but, even before we reached the Doldrums,
which was about a third of the way, we were not surprised
to find there were no medical comforts left. Our worthy
captain was very much concerned, especially as about
that time the potatoes had given out, the fresh meat had
been consumed&mdash;even to the last poor fowl&mdash;and the so-called
baker declared that he was absolutely unable to
give us any decent bread. So we had a lively two months
to look forward to. Personally I did not mind. Instead
of getting better, as the weather got warmer I became
worse. I was taken every day from my bunk into one
of the ship&#8217;s boats, which hung on the side, and made
as comfortable as I could be, and got as much fresh air
as was available. Everyone was kind, and, in the absence
of any pain, I was not unhappy. But I did not look
forward with any degrees of pleasure to the time when,
on crossing the line, we should leave the warm climates,
and, picking up the south-easterly trades off the South
American coast, enter the cold regions through which the
rest of the voyage had to be made. But one never knows.
My friend, the doctor, who had been most sanguine in
promising me the full use of my limbs as the weather became
warmer, was more than puzzled, so much so that I
fancied he fully anticipated my final collapse as soon as
the cold weather came on; and I sometimes thought, too,
that he did regret that the medical comforts in his charge
had been consumed so early in the voyage.</p>
<p>Well, we reached the tropics, and for three days the
Doldrums held us. They had the usual festivities when
crossing the Line, and Father Neptune visited us. Our
worthy captain pleased all the passengers by the hearty
way in which he entered into all their amusements. From
my perch in my boat I enjoyed what I then thought were
the last few days I had to live. Then came the day when
a slight ripple appeared in the calm waters, which presaged
a light breeze. This breeze turned into a fairly
strong wind&mdash;and we had picked up the south-easterly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
trade. To my great relief, and to the very considerable
astonishment of the doctor, from that moment I began to
improve. As, each day, we made to the south, the cooler
became the wind and the rougher the sea. It was a fine
trade wind, and we bowled along with all sail set doing
our eight or nine knots an hour day and night. And
each day I felt better. Before we doubled the Cape of
Good Hope and entered the long stretch which, tracking
along the Southern Seas, due east, was to land us in New
Zealand, I was actually walking with some slight help,
and from that time onwards I improved to such an extent
that I was able to take my turn now and again with one
of the watches as an able seaman.</p>
<p>It was a long weary journey across those Southern
Seas. The monotony of it, day after day, with the
following wind, wave after wave apparently threatening
to overtake us, yet our poop deck ever avoiding
them. And so on until we reached Stewart Island.
We made the North Passage, and on November 4, just
ninety-two days after leaving London, we entered Port
Chalmers.</p>
<p>Port Chalmers is the Port of Dunedin, that fine city
in the South Island of New Zealand. Dunedin was named
after the city of Edinburgh, which was once known as
Dunedin. It is just chock full of Scotsmen, and it is
very much to be doubted whether a better name could have
been given it by those sons of Scotland who first made
their home there. The climate of Dunedin much resembles
the climate of Edinburgh itself. Snow covers its streets
in the winter, and the great Mount Cook, clad in snow,
hovers away in the far distance. Down towards the south
scenery which not even the fiords of Norway can rival
extends from the bluff towards the north. Milford Sounds
are well known for their great beauty to all those who have
travelled in those waters. I doubt whether there is any
part of the world which, within such distances, is more
magnificently picturesque than that southern corner of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
the South Island of New Zealand. Enough; this is not
a guide book.</p>
<p>We landed at Port Chalmers and proceeded to Waine&#8217;s
Hotel. It was kept, I need hardly say, by a Scotsman,
and it is there still. I felt that I had started a new lease
of life. I couldn&#8217;t believe it possible that I had got rid
of every pain and ache and that I was as fit as fit could
be. My first concern was to cable home and tell them not
only of my safe arrival, but of the wonderful recovery that
I had made, and that I intended to at once get to work
and take advantage of the letters of introduction that I had
taken with me. Two of these were to men in Dunedin,
and, curiously enough, one of them was a well-known
local man, who happened to be the Officer Commanding
the Volunteer Artillery Company. He was most kind.
He was a very keen volunteer soldier, and he informed me
that the great difficulty he had to contend with was the
fact that the Government would not place at his disposal
a qualified instructor for his corps. &#8220;If you are going to
stay here a little time,&#8221; he said, &#8220;will you give a short
course of instruction to my men?&#8221; I was only too
pleased, and, within two days of my arrival in Dunedin,
a parade of the corps was held in their drill-hall&mdash;which,
by the by, was an excellent one&mdash;and we made all arrangements
to commence business. It was like old times again.
Who could have told me, when I was leaving London,
three months before, as I thought a cripple, that I was
going to be at work again, as fresh as ever, within three
months, at the other side of the world? One introduction
led to another, till I found it difficult to find time to take
advantage of all the kind invitations that were given me.</p>
<p>I had decided, however, that it was to Wellington, the
seat of the New Zealand Government, that I had to make
my way. It was at Wellington that the responsible head
of the New Zealand defence and police force resided&mdash;good
old Colonel Reader. I had letters of introduction to him,
and I thought it advisable, in view of my experience in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
Dunedin, to interview him as early as possible, as he
might consider my experience as a Gunner of some value
to the Government. I left my friends in Dunedin with
many regrets, and full of promises to return to their hospitable
city should the authorities at Wellington deem it
advisable to appoint an instructor to their district. I was
sorry to leave Dunedin. The town possessed, and possesses,
one of the nicest clubs in the southern hemisphere&mdash;the
Fernhill Club, a most comfortable residence, standing
in its own grounds, quite in the centre of the city.</p>
<p>On reaching Wellington I called upon Colonel Reader,
and apparently my luck was in. He told me that he was
looking out for a Drill Instructor and that he would
be pleased if I could take the appointment. The emolument
seemed to me enormous. It was just four times the
amount I had been receiving as a lieutenant in the artillery.
In addition, it carried travelling expenses and other perquisites.
I accepted at once, and was ordered to take up
my duties at first in the North Island, at a place called
Tauranga, not far from the scene of the fight at the Gate
Pah, during the Maori War. Anyone visiting Tauranga
can still trace the site of the old British camp and the
remains of the old trenches.</p>
<p>Not far from the Gate Pah, in what was then called
The King Country, lay Ohinemutu, the Maori settlement,
alongside which rose the celebrated Terraces&mdash;later on,
somewhere about 1885, the scene of the terrible eruptions
which completely wiped out that wonderful country, submerged
the terraces and mountains, and formed fresh
lakes in what is now well known as the Rotorua district.
How soon or how late further eruptions will take place in
this district, where now a modern hotel and marble baths
have taken the place of Maori whares and mud-holes, it
is not for me to say.</p>
<p>While at Tauranga I became acquainted with the
method then in vogue of settling people on the land in
New Zealand. A retired officer, who had himself migrated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
thither, and had secured a holding not far from the township
of Tauranga, obtained from the Government a large
area of land, north of Tauranga, on the road towards
Grahamstown and the Thames Goldfield. It was reported
at the time that the price he had paid the Government
was ten shillings per acre, right out. This tract of country
was completely covered with bracken, and bracken is a
difficult growth to get rid of. Proceeding to England, he
induced a good many of his friends to try their fortune
on the other side of the world, offering them land at an
upset price of two pounds per acre&mdash;good land, beautiful
climate, great possibilities. It was a very tempting offer
to those who knew no better, and he succeeded in practically
disposing of the land on these terms. The greater
number of these would-be pioneers were retired officers,
an ex-bishop or two, retired clergymen, and others of a
similar walk in life, who, one would naturally think, were
the least qualified to battle at their time of life with the
problems of cultivating unknown lands in far-distant
colonies. The promoter, if report is correct, chartered two
sailing vessels, and into these endless furniture, pianos,
household goods, belonging to the settlers, were duly
packed. Yet, remember, all that they were to find on their
arrival was bracken&mdash;no houses, no fences, no roads,
nothing but bracken. Not one of them knew which
portion of the bracken was to be his own. Part of the
contract was that, during the voyage out, the settlers were
to draw lots for the allotment of positions, the value of
which they could only judge from a map hung up in the
saloon of the ship.</p>
<p>I rode through this settlement about one year after
the arrival of the settlers. There were a certain number of
huts, intended finally to be homesteads, in the course of
being built. A few tracks formed the so-called roads.
Some of the bracken was disappearing. But the ready
money which the settlers, or some of them, had brought
out with them had been spent, and the outlook was anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
but cheerful. Further, the necessary conditions for
the survey of the allotments&mdash;as required by the Government&mdash;had
not been fulfilled. Consequently the settlers
were unable to borrow any funds on their property, unless
they applied to the Jews. This is many years ago, and,
though I have not been there lately, I believe that it is
now a most prosperous district. But how many of those
courageous original settlers or their families are there now?</p>
<p>In connexion with the eruption at Ohinemutu there
was an incident which it is worth while to record. Should
it occur again, the record should act as a sure warning
to the residents at Rotorua. Situated some thirty miles
from the coast, to the eastwards of Tauranga, there is an
island. It rises in the shape of a conical hill clean out of
the sea. It was then known as Sulphur Island, or perhaps
better as White Island. As a matter of fact it was an
old volcano, though never quite extinct. On landing at
this island you would have found that the conical hill
was absolutely hollow, and that on its base, in the inside,
level with the sea, lay a lake, whose waters were of the
dark blue hue that only sulphur lakes can show. The
specific gravity of the water is very heavy, much the same
as that of the blue lake in the Mount Gambier district,
in South Australia, at the top edge of which Adam Lindsay
Gordon made his famous jump over a high fence.
From both the inner and the outer crust of this shell
mountain continually poured sulphur deposits, practically
pure sulphur. On the outward side of the mountain this
sulphur accumulated on the base, towards the beach. It
was indeed a glorious sight, on a moonlight night, to
look at this peak rising majestically from amidst the waves
of mid-ocean, white as a sugar-loaf, as the rays of the
moon bathed it with its silvery light.</p>
<p>Beautiful as it looked, it was yet tainted with the
saddest of histories. Though it was known that at some
period or another it had been inhabited by natives, yet
no fresh water could then be found within its shores.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
The only solution that could be found for the fact that it
had been inhabited was that some springs of fresh water
existed between the low and high water mark of the tide
which were known to the then inhabitants, but the
knowledge of the situation of these springs had died
with them. The sulphur, however, almost in its
pure state, was there in abundance, and White Island,
at the time I am speaking of, was leased by the Government
to a small syndicate, which employed a certain
number of hands, and exported the sulphur, chiefly to
Tauranga. It was a fine paying game for that merry
small syndicate. The conditions, however, under which
white men were bound to labour at White Island were as
sad and as deplorable as it has ever been my lot to know.
Any man who decided to fill sulphur bags at White Island
knew that he was going to his last home in this world.
The conditions of life on the island were practically hopeless.
The strong sulphur fumes ate up one&#8217;s vitality.
One&#8217;s teeth fell out. Nothing but woollen clothes could
withstand the ravages of the fumes. Eyesight failed.
The only fresh water available was that which was
landed on the Island by the schooners which carried
away the sulphur bags. The spirit of those labourers
was broken, and they were content to finish their lives
under the influence of the strong and adulterated spirits
with which those same schooners supplied them, thus helping
them on their passage to another world. Sulphur
(or White) Island is doubtless still there, and, no doubt,
supplying many tons of that most useful product of this
earth under very much happier conditions.</p>
<p>But, to hark back to the incident of the wonderful volcano
upheaval which wrecked Ohinemutu and its terraces,
its mountains and its lakes. For about a month previous to
the eruptions the captains of the coastal boats plying along
the eastern coast from Wellington to Auckland, making
Gisborne, Napier and Tauranga their ports of call, noticed
that when travelling between White Island and the main
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
coast they passed through shoals of dead fish floating on
the surface of the sea. They were astonished at this, but
they failed to arrive at any solution of the phenomenon.
It was not till after the eruptions took place that these
reports caused the Government authorities to attempt to
trace a connexion between the shoals of dead fish on the
waters and the eruption at Ohinemutu. The result of these
investigations proved&mdash;as far as it was reported at the
time&mdash;that serious volcanic disturbances had been taking
place between White Island and the mainland, unknown
and unseen, but the result of which was apparently proved
by the presence on the surface of the waters of the dead
or stunned fish. All boys know that a concussion caused
in waters where there are fish, stuns them and brings them
to the surface, ready to be gathered in by the enterprising
but unsportsmanlike spirit who fires off the exploding
charge. That a great explosion and upheaval had taken
place within the deep sea was proved by the experience
of the skippers in the coasting trade. I think I am making
a correct statement when I say that the connexion between
White Island and the District of Ohinemutu on the mainland,
as volcanic centres, was established.</p>
<p>My duties, as I have already stated, were not onerous.
My chief work, as instructor, was minimized by the small
number of troopers. I had under me some thirty or forty
mounted men. The Maoris were somewhat restless between
the east and west, and they proved that restlessness
by making raids on the working parties which were then
employed on road making through the Parihaka district.
Their chief delight was to raid the road-makers&#8217; piles of
broken metal and scatter it, broadcast, from their well-constructed
heaps.</p>
<p>Before I left Tauranga an incident occurred which
appealed to me very much as an instance of the curious
ways of Providence. I was riding back one afternoon after
visiting some of the country patrols. I had filled my pipe,
but discovered that I had no matches. Presently I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
noticed, on the right-hand side of the road amidst the
bracken, a very humble abode. As a matter of fact, it
was just what was then known as a &#8220;lean-to,&#8221; the preliminary
stage of the farmhouses that were then being
built by the settlers. These &#8220;lean-tos&#8221; were, in the first
instance used for living purposes. Later on, when the
front parts of the houses were built, they became the
kitchens and domestic offices. The building was only
some four hundred yards from the road, so I turned in to
get a light for my pipe. I noticed, as I was getting near,
that a man was standing on a step-ladder, apparently
doing some painting. He looked down on me from his
ladder as I approached. Then I saw that instead of
painting he was engaged in tarring the roof of the building.
He was evidently an amateur tar-man. The bucket
which held the tar was tied on to the ladder below him.
The roof he was tarring was a little above him, with the
result that he himself was fairly covered with sprinklings
of the tar. As he possessed a pair of somewhat large
whiskers and his head was uncovered, he presented a
quaint appearance. After greetings, I ventured to ask if
he could supply me with a few matches.</p>
<p>As he turned and looked down on me from his perch
on the ladder, I recognized an old friend at whose beautiful
country house in the county of Cork in Ireland I had
spent many, many happy hours when I was quartered at
Carlisle Fort. I could hardly believe that he was the host
who had been so kind to all of us young officers only a
few months before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you are not Colonel &mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, &#8220;you probably won&#8217;t remember me,
but I do remember you and all the pleasure you used to
give us. Are you all out here? Where are the girls?&#8221;</p>
<p>I introduced myself, and he did remember me. The
result was that he asked me to stay to their evening meal,
which invitation I gladly accepted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>As he landed from the ladder he laughed, and he said,
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m not much of an adept at tarring. It&#8217;s
only been my second attempt, and it takes me such an
awful time to get rid of the amount of the tar which I so
freely distribute over myself. But I am sure you won&#8217;t
mind our primitive ways, and if this abode is not as
pretentious as the old castle in County Cork, still we can
all give you a very hearty welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>I put up my horse in the shed which did duty as a
stable. He told me that the two sons were away with the
milk cart, while the girls were hard at work doing the
evening&#8217;s milking of the cows and feeding the poultry,
and would shortly finish their day&#8217;s work. In the meantime,
we would have a pipe and stroll round what he called
the domain. We were a cheery party that met at that
evening meal. The girls appeared, looking sweet in their
very best clothes. The old man and his sons put on evening
dress. The centre room was a living-room, drawing-room,
dining-room, smoking-room, library, all combined
in one. The table on which dinner was served was made of
rough boards resting on a couple of trestles, but covered
with the best of damask tablecloths and silver ornaments.
The dining-room chairs consisted of empty packing cases.
Such were the difficulties that the early settlers had to
contend with.</p>
<p>Some years afterwards I was paying an official call
on one of Her Majesty&#8217;s ships at Adelaide, South Australia,
and the commander asked me to go into his cabin,
where I saw a photograph of a sweetly pretty woman.
I recognized it at once. It was one of the three sisters
with whom I had dined some years before. I mentioned
the fact, and asked him if she was a relation of his. &#8220;Very
much so,&#8221; he said; &#8220;she is my wife.&#8221; He then told me all
about the family, and that they had done well, and the
farm had been a great success.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>A MAORI MEETING</h3>
</div>

<p>At this time Tauranga itself was a centre of another kind
of activity. Exeter Hall had exerted its wonderful influence
in attempting to settle all sorts of questions affecting
the Empire and the management of Imperial interests
in the colonies, the governing of which had already been
handed over to the care of those who had so ably
developed them. Exeter Hall had influenced the Imperial
Government to call upon the New Zealand Government
to make monetary compensation to the Maoris for the loss,
or so-called loss, of portions of the land which had been
taken from them as the result of the Maori War.</p>
<p>A very considerable tract of land, then known as the
King Country, lay to the west of Tauranga, and included,
I think, the Ohinemutu district. Riding from Tauranga
towards the west, you passed through the bracken country
and then arrived at the magnificent bush, which began
at a place called Europe, known as &#8220;Orope&#8221; by the
Maoris. Glorious and magnificent trees towered overhead,
while hundreds of creepers and other semi-tropical plants
grew so intensely that it was more than difficult to
force a way through. Herein was the home of the supple-jack,
whose branches enfolded you more and more the
longer you attempted to force your way through. Here
was the home of the wild boar. A large tract of this
country formed part of the land for which compensation
was to be paid by the Government to the Maoris in
accordance with the dictates of Exeter Hall.</p>
<p>Courts of jurisdiction were established at several centres
of the population. The courts consisted of an English
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
justice and a native assessor. One of these courts was
established at Tauranga. The question for the court to
decide was which Maori tribe, at the time of the close
of the Maori War, were actually the rightful owners of
the particular land in dispute. I was informed at the
time&mdash;and I think my information was correct&mdash;that the
title of ownership lay, in accordance with the Maori
traditions, with the chief of a tribe who had actually killed
(and eaten part of) his unsuccessful rival. The courts
arranged to make duly known to all tribes that put forward
a claim to any such lands, the dates on which sittings
would be held to deal with each case in rotation.</p>
<p>I was at Tauranga when the court was sitting, and
a wonderful experience it was. The value of the tract
of land under consideration in this one case was some
£6,500. Remember that it was not intended to restore
the land to the Maoris. They were to be compensated
only in cash value for the loss of the land. In this particular
instance there were three tribes whose chiefs claimed
to have been in possession at the time of the war, and
who desired to appear before the court. The procedure
was as follows: The court sat at Tauranga. The tribes
declined to be represented by the chiefs, even if accompanied
by a few of their elder tribesmen; they insisted
upon attending the courts with the whole tribe, men,
women and children. Their average number was about
380. Provision had to be made for suitable camps during
the course of the trial. What a time for the furniture
dealers, storekeepers, butchers, bakers, and other tradesmen,
whose pleasant duty it became to make such provision!
Remember that all expenses which the tribes
incurred were a charge on the capital value of £6,500.
The Maoris cared not. They did not realize that they
were actually paying for their own subsistence. The sole
aim of each tribe was to win its case. The local authorities
fixed the localities for the camps and made all arrangements
for their comfort on a liberal scale. The first tribe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
to arrive found their quarters ready for them, and it then
became their privilege to welcome the second tribe, which
came from across the water, a small arm of the sea to
the south of the town. This tribe swam across, men,
women and children, to the head of the jetty to which
the local steamers made fast. The Maoris who lived in
close proximity to the sea were excellent swimmers.</p>
<p>The order of procedure was as follows: The tribe
already in possession of the camp piled up a couple of
trucks with barrels of beer, bottles of rum, gin, brandy
and whisky. These trucks were run down the rails to
the end of the jetty and were left there to await the arrival
of the swimming tribe, while the others remained on the
shore end to welcome them. The new-comers, tired after
their long swim, greatly appreciated the kind thought of
their hosts, and immediately set to work to consume as
much of the good gifts as the gods, or, rather, their
legal opponents, offered them. These, drawn up in battle
array, impatiently awaited their arrival, the braves all in
front in such a position as they considered advisable, from
their military point of view, to impress their guests with
a sense of their prowess. Behind the fighting line the
womenfolk were drawn up. In their front line were their
best-looking girls. They were specially put there to catch
the eye of the leading young men among their guests.
The elderly women and the youngsters formed the third
line.</p>
<p>Thus the hosts waited for the arrival of their guests.
The original idea was that the tribe arriving would take
a certain amount of the drink offered to them, enough to
fortify themselves so as to arrive at the end of the jetty
in fairly good condition. But the hopes of the hosts
were unjustified. There was nothing left on the trolley
at the end of the jetty but empty beer barrels and glass
bottles. Watching them as I did, from the little fort
just overlooking the jetty, I was wondering how the
advance of the visiting tribe down the jetty was going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
to be carried out. I gathered, from what I had seen, that
the amount of spirits consumed would produce some
comical effects. I was quite disappointed. I wondered also
whether the procession down the jetty was to be carried
out in the clothes in which they arrived, which were nil.
It would have been a quaint experience to have seen a
whole naked tribe arriving at quite a respectable English
settlement. But, no. Their coverings had been carefully
carried by the swimmers on the top of their heads and
kept dry. And while they refreshed themselves from the
friendly truck they donned such garments as made them
quite respectable.</p>
<p>The order for the advance was then formed. It
was similar to that which was to receive them on the
shore end of the jetty. One could not help admiring
their methods. Ceremonial parades all over the world,
held at coronations of kings, in commemoration of the
proclamation of a country&#8217;s victories, aided by the pomp
and glory of all modern accessories, failed to convey
the solemnity, such as it was, of the advance of that
tribe down that jetty. Led by the chief and chieftains
of the tribe, followed by their &#8220;braves,&#8221; that is, their
fighting men, the march down the jetty began. There
was no band, and no music but their battle-cry&mdash;a battle-cry
that had made them redoubtable enemies and had
forced us to send a large expeditionary force, with all
the then best military resources, to overcome them. Down
the jetty they came, moving in complete unison that shook
the structure itself as they beat it in their advance. As
they came forward their hosts joined in rhythm with
their advance, stamping on the shore end till the ground,
too, shook. The scene became quite inspiring. I have
never been present at any review or parade&mdash;and I have
seen many in many parts of the world&mdash;which has so
impressed me or left such a keen impression in my mind
as that of the moment when the two tribes met at the
shore end of that jetty. You may think this is rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
a far-fetched thought, but it isn&#8217;t, and you wouldn&#8217;t have
thought so if you had been there.</p>
<p>The official meeting of the chiefs first took place. The
rhythmical beating of the ground by the hundreds of feet
of the hosts and guests suddenly ceased, and a friendly
greeting of all, which, in the usage of the Maoris, took
the form of rubbing noses, began and held full sway. The
arriving tribe settled down then to the camp provided
for them by the authorities. Two days afterwards the
third tribe arrived, and the same ceremony took place.
The ground then again shook unmistakably. It took one
back&mdash;as many of the residents of Tauranga (who after
fighting in the Maori War had settled in the district)
remembered&mdash;to the days of that campaign and to the
battle-cry of the advancing Maoris whom they had fought
against. But these very men were now engaged in the
pursuits of peace, and all of them welcomed with delight
the presence of their late enemies. It was the source of
much profit to them.</p>
<p>This particular case was duly settled by the court.
Its decision was given in favour, if I remember rightly,
of the tribe that swam across from the south. The court
officials were entrusted with the settlement of the expenses
incurred by the tribes. After paying all these expenses
a sum of some one thousand pounds remained as the
amount to be paid in compensation, in accordance with
the edict of Exeter Hall, to the winners.</p>
<p>The final celebration had now to take place. The chief
of the victorious tribe invited the losing tribes to a farewell
festival. A great Maori haka was held, to which not
only the natives themselves, but the whole of the English
inhabitants, were invited. The braves of all the tribes
took part in this. It was a wonderful scene. It took
place upon a moonlight night. There was an inner circle,
in the centre of which the triumphant chief and his chieftains,
surrounded by the chief and chieftains of the other
two tribes, stood. Around them was a palisade of sticks,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
on which the one thousand odd pounds in notes, paid to
them as a result of the court&#8217;s finding, were festooned.
Immediately surrounding this circle were the braves of
the losing tribes, and beyond, all round, the womenfolk
and the children and European guests. Fires flared in all
directions. You have no doubt read about the natives of
different parts of the world, but you may not know that the
Maori race was, without exception, one of the best indigenous
types in our Empire.</p>
<p>Well, the scene was set and the war-dance started.
Victors and losers joined, in complete accord with their
own customs, and I doubt if a more inspiring sight,
taking in view their numbers, has been seen. As their
enthusiasm increased the greater became their rhythmical
movements. As their vigour increased the more weird
became the scene. They were fighting, in their minds,
their old battles against their old foe&mdash;battles which they
had fought with their native weapons against weapons
of civilization. Their old war-cries leapt forth from their
hearts and mouths as they had done when they fell before
their enemy. They looked bewitched, and stayed not
nor stopped in their wild orgy until physical distress
forced them.</p>
<p>Next day they departed to their own settlement, and
peace and quiet reigned in Tauranga, whose residents
were more than grateful to Exeter Hall for the result
of the great interest which the promoters of the meetings
for the welfare of the poor Maori had aroused. Tauranga&#8217;s
civil population revelled in profit. When the tribes left
the whole of the camp equipments were left behind. The
Government did not want them, and the whole concern
was put up to auction. Who was going to bid? Only
the local suppliers. There was no opposition, and the
whole equipment was sold to the only bidders. <i>Verbum
sap.</i>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>AN OFFER FROM THE GOVERNOR OF TASMANIA</h3>
</div>

<p>My life in Tauranga was becoming every day more
interesting. Fishing, both fresh water in the Wairoa,
and deep sea, was excellent. Any amount of shooting
could be got within easy driving distance from the township&mdash;red-legged
partridges, rabbits, and any number of
pheasants; as a matter of fact, these were looked upon
by the farmers as vermin, they were so plentiful, and they
did much damage to their grain crops. Some eighteen
miles away one reached the border of the King Country,
the large tract of land then in the hands of the Maoris. At
this border the natural bush commenced. Wonderful
timber, among which semi-tropical creeping plants revelled
in forming almost impassable barriers, so luxurious were
their growth. Wild boar hunting was most exciting as
well as dangerous. Supple-jack was one of the most
treacherous parasites of the giant forest trunks, for, notwithstanding
hand axes, the deeper you cut your way,
the more entangled you became. Our patrolling duties
often necessitated our being away for five or six days,
and enabled us to get some excellent sport. There was
but little trouble with the Maoris. They somewhat objected
to the making of roads, which were then being
extended inland towards the west coast, and they were a
source of some annoyance to the working parties; but the
appearance of one of our armed patrols soon brought them
to reason.</p>
<p>Ohinemutu was a Maori village at the foot of the
wonderful hills up whose slopes rose the marvellous pink
and white terraces which were, a few years later, to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
wiped off the face of the earth by the terrible volcanic
eruptions that devastated that part of the North Island.
Acting upon the advice of our doctor I decided to take
a short course of the sulphur mud baths which were
scattered here and there over the ground. Having obtained
permission from Te-Whiti, the then king, I spent
eight days at Ohinemutu. The two chief guides, Maria
and Sophia, were well known in those days to all tourists
who were fortunate enough to visit that wonderful region.
I had been free from any rheumatic pains since my landing
at Dunedin, but the doctor assured me that the sulphur
baths would complete the cure. He was right, as I am
thankful to say that from that day to this the old enemy
has never tackled me again, though I am afraid I have
sorely tempted him.</p>
<p>It was one day shortly after my sojourn at Ohinemutu
that I received a letter from Sir Frederick Weld, the then
Governor of Tasmania, offering me the position of private
secretary, which had become vacant. I had taken out
letters of introduction to him from some mutual friends,
which I had posted on my arrival in Dunedin; hence his
offer. I was naturally delighted, and cabled accepting.
Without delay I tendered my resignation to the officer in
command of our district, Major Swinley, who told me I
could count upon its being accepted, and could make my
arrangements to leave for Tasmania as soon as a steamer
was available. I found there would be one leaving Auckland
for Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin in a few
days. This was indeed fortunate, for it would enable me
to see Auckland, call upon our chief, Colonel Reader,
at Wellington, thank him for his kindness in giving me
the appointment at Tauranga, and say good-bye to all
my old friends at Dunedin. At Auckland, a beautifully
situated city with an excellent and picturesque harbour,
I spent some four days, having ridden from Tauranga
through the Kati-kati settlement, the old Thames Gold
Fields, and finishing my most interesting journey in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
little steamer, the <i>Rotomahana</i>, sailing from Grahamstown.
On arrival at Wellington I called on Colonel
Reader. He expressed much surprise at seeing me, and
told me that as he had no recollection of having received
any application from me for leave, he failed to understand
on what grounds I had come to Wellington. I was, of
course, surprised myself that he had not heard from
Major Swinley, and explained to him exactly what had
happened. He appeared considerably annoyed, and told
me that Major Swinley should not have permitted me to
leave Tauranga before the application for leave had been
approved by himself; but, as he had done so, he would not
stand in the way of my bettering my position, and would
accept my resignation. I thanked him and returned to
the steamer, which sailed next morning for Christchurch.</p>
<p>In due course I arrived in Dunedin. Here a real surprise
awaited me. It was a cable from Sir Frederick
Weld to the effect that he had received instructions from
the Colonial Office to proceed without delay to Singapore,
where he had been appointed Governor, and where his
presence was urgently required. He expressed his regret
that the alteration in his plans forced him to cancel his
offer, and hoped that it would not cause me much inconvenience.
There was nothing for it but to bow to the
inevitable, break my journey, and put my thinking-cap on.</p>
<p>I had wired to some of my friends in Dunedin, advising
them of the fact that the steamer would be calling at the
port, and that I would be glad to see them again. Two
or three of them were waiting on the pier on the steamer&#8217;s
arrival. They were much concerned at my bad news, did
their best to cheer me up, and promised me a good time
while I stayed with them. Being young, I put aside my
troubles for the time and determined to take them at their
word and enjoy myself. Plenty of time for worry by and
by. At the end of the week the senior officer of the local
garrison battery came to see me. He said his officers had
asked him to apply to the Government to have me appointed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
as artillery instructor to the district, which then
included the port of Invercargill, otherwise the Bluff, and
that he had that day sent on an application to that effect,
supported by the local Members of Parliament, and other
influential citizens. He was quite optimistic as to the
result, but I had my doubts. He had not been present
at my interview with Colonel Reader at Wellington. I
felt convinced that the chief had been much annoyed
at what he no doubt thought the cavalier way in which
I had left my job at Tauranga, after his having given me
the appointment to that district so quickly after my application.
However, hope is the mother of cheer, and I felt
more reconciled to my lot. Later on arrived Colonel
Reader&#8217;s answer. It was short and to the point, but a
bad point for me. He regretted he was unable to recommend
the reappointment of an officer who had resigned at
such short notice.</p>
<p>It was all over. I had fallen between two stools.
Well, it could not be helped; why cry over spilt milk?
After all, I had been more than fortunate in regaining
my health. I had spent some six months in one of the
most beautiful and interesting countries in the world,
gained much experience, enjoyed endless good sport,
made many friends. Why despond? Nothing in it.
Life was still before me. My friends in Dunedin and
Christchurch invited me to visit their stations, fish, shoot,
eat, dance and play. I would put in some three
months enjoying myself, and then make for home and
Wardhouse again. The journey homewards would give
me the opportunity of visiting Australia, India and Egypt,
and on arrival home I would have been round the world.
Some experience, as an American would say, for a young
man who, twelve months before, had boarded a sailing
vessel in the London Docks with little hope of leaving the
ship alive.</p>
<p>One of the most thrilling experiences I have ever had
occurred while I made the attempt to climb the peak of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
that lofty mountain, Mount Cook. The time of the year
was not the best to venture on such an expedition. On
both occasions, when we tackled the venture, ill-luck befell
us. Our first attempt was foiled by fogs, which, when
driven away by a fierce, bitterly cold gale, that seemed to
blow from any and every point of the compass at the
same time, were succeeded by sleet and hailstorms that
forced us to give up the fight and return home sadder but
wiser men. The second time of asking, after a splendid
start, once again the Fates were against us, and a heavy fall
of snow, which lasted three days, put an end to our
ambitious undertaking.</p>
<p>Then my round of visits came to an end, and I took
my passage to Melbourne, sorry to leave so many friends,
and little thinking that, in after years, I would again see
them and enjoy their hospitality in those beautiful
southern islands.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>I BECOME A NEWSPAPER PROPRIETOR</h3>
</div>

<p>On arrival in Melbourne I took up my quarters in the
old White Hart Hotel at the corner of Bourke Street and
Spring Gardens, at that time one of the most comfortable
hotels in Melbourne. Situated as it is just opposite the present
Federal Houses of Parliament, it is well known indeed
by many members both of the House of Representatives
and the Senate. The topic of the day was the opening
of the Exhibition, and the official representatives of the
foreign nations who were taking part had by this time
arrived in Melbourne. The representative of the German
Empire was in residence, amongst others, at the White
Hart Hotel.</p>
<p>I must tell you of a little incident which should have
finished in someone&#8217;s death, but did not. The German
Commissioner&#8217;s private secretary had just been long
enough in Melbourne to fall in love with the daughter
of a well-known tradesman. She was certainly a strikingly
handsome girl, and her charms had completely roped
in the affections of that gentleman. This girl, then about
eighteen years of age, was engaged, or going to be engaged,
to be married to a local man. The private secretary
was so persistent in his attentions and admiration
that he roused the devil in the heart of her fiancé, who
challenged the private secretary to a mortal duel. It was to
be a fight to the death, so he stated in the challenge, which
arrived at our hotel at about 10 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>P.M.</span> on a Tuesday evening,
just as we were sitting down to a game of whist. The
private secretary solemnly handed the written challenge
to his chief. The Commissioner read it, then said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
&#8220;Write a note in answer stating that our under-secretary
will represent you, and meet at once a representative of
your opponent here at the hotel, with the view of arranging
a meeting between you at five o&#8217;clock to-morrow morning.&#8221;
It was summer time. &#8220;Would you prefer swords
or pistols?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Swords,&#8221; said the private secretary.</p>
<p>The letter was written and sent, and swords were to be
the weapons.</p>
<p>Our game of cards was put off for the moment, but, as
I was afterwards informed, the intervening minutes while
the letter was being written had been taken advantage of
by the Commissioner to avoid a scandal. He sent word
to the German Consul requesting his immediate presence
at the hotel. On the Consul&#8217;s arrival the Commissioner
met him privately, explained the situation, and requested
the Consul at once to inform the Commissioner of Police
of the intended duel between the two lovers, and to ask
the Commissioner to prevent it. The Consul quickly left
the hotel to carry out his instructions. The game of whist
then proceeded. The private secretary was not playing
too well. No wonder. Even a German under the circumstances
could not have been but somewhat nervous.
He needed not to have been nervous if he had been made
aware of the Commissioner&#8217;s instructions to the Consul.</p>
<p>At about a quarter to twelve o&#8217;clock, as we were finishing
our last rubber, the waiter brought in word that two
gentlemen desired to see the Commissioner. He asked
the waiter to show them into the room. On their coming
in they informed the Commissioner that they were extremely
sorry to disturb him at that late hour, that they
were police officers, that information had been received
that a breach of the peace was contemplated, that the
private secretary was one of the persons concerned, and,
further, that their orders were to arrest him. As, however,
he was a guest of the Government, it would be more
than sufficient if the Commissioner would guarantee that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
no breach of the peace by any one of his staff would take
place. I was looking at the private secretary as this statement
was made. I do not think I ever saw upon anyone&#8217;s
face such a look of relief as came to his.</p>
<p>This ended his affair, as he was made to promise by
the Commissioner that the lady-love was to be forgotten
and not to be spoken to again during their stay in
Melbourne.</p>
<p>Having determined to see as much of Australia as
possible before I went home, I bethought myself of the
letters of introduction which I had brought out with me
from home. Amongst them was one to General Sir
Peter Scratchley, R.E., who had been, at the request of
the Australian Colonies, sent out by the War Office to
advise them as to suitable positions and type of fortifications
to be erected for the protection of the chief
harbours and other vulnerable localities along the Australian
coast. I called on him. He was affable and kind.
He gave me considerable encouragement by telling me
that as some of the forts were being completed it was
becoming necessary to increase the Permanent Artillery
Force to man them, and that&mdash;it seemed to him&mdash;I had
just arrived in time, as my qualifications were satisfactory.
He undertook to introduce me personally to the Premier,
Mr. Graham Berry, who advised me to send in a written
application for an appointment and promised General
Scratchley to give it his favourable consideration when
the opportunity arose. Just about this time I received
a letter from my old friend, Sir Frederick Weld, at Singapore,
stating that he was reorganizing the Native Police
Force in that colony and wanted to appoint a few British
officers to it. He offered me the position of second in command.
This offer was most alluring to me, but General
Scratchley simply ridiculed it. He told me he knew Singapore
only too well, and that if I went I would probably die
in a few years&mdash;if I lived as long, and at any rate that
I would become an old man before my time. Far better,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
he said, stay in a glorious country like Australia than go
and work in a country only fit for niggers, and poor at
that. Taking his advice I declined Sir Frederick Weld&#8217;s
kind offer. I wrote to him, thanking him, and pointed
out that I was somewhat afraid to go and live in such a
hot and moist climate after my sad experiences during
my voyage out in the tropical regions, specially as since
my landing in New Zealand I had not felt a twinge of
rheumatism.</p>
<p>So I made up my mind to wait in Melbourne until I
obtained my military appointment. I could not, however,
afford to live in idleness, so I looked round for some
suitable occupation which would bring in grist to the mill.
I had always been, as you know, very fond of sport, and
horse racing is the leading sport in Australia. I had been
attending the meetings in and near Melbourne regularly
and had become acquainted with a good many sporting
men and the principal bookmakers and trainers. It struck
me that it was a pity that a large city, the capital of
a most thriving colony, where all kind of sport was rife,
possessed no daily sporting paper. The one evening
paper in Melbourne, <i>The Herald</i>, usually devoted some
space to sport, but it was not published till too late in
the day to be of any value to race-goers and punters. I
determined to start a &#8220;sporting news-sheet,&#8221; to be
published for the ten days covering the forthcoming
Melbourne Cup Meeting. This news-sheet would be on
sale at 10 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>A.M.</span> in the morning, and give the latest information
even up to the last morning&#8217;s gallops&mdash;if any&mdash;the
scratchings, and latest betting prices. I at once set to
work and got two reliable sporting men possessing good
all-round racing information to join me in the venture.
Then I took a set of offices, which were really much too
extravagant and in too good a position. The offices were
in the best part of Collins Street. But I was a very
sanguine young man in those days. It was my first
venture in business bar the roller-skating. As a matter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
of fact, not one of us three had any knowledge or experience
in business. We arranged that it should be my work
to collect advertisements, attend to the editing and printing,
do the financing, and see to the sale of the <i>Turf Tissue</i>,
the name selected for the publication. My two partners&#8217;
business was to visit the training tracks, watch the horses
at work, get all the information they could out of trainers,
jockeys and stable-boys, and advise the public what horses
to back.</p>
<p>Looking at it without prejudice, it seemed quite a good
proposition on paper. So on we went. The <i>Turf Tissue</i>
was to be sold to the public at twopence a copy, a half-penny
of which was to go to the seller. It was a good
commission, but by giving it we hoped to attract a very
large number of the newsboys who sold the evening paper,
in view of the fact that by publishing the <i>Tissue</i> at 10 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>A.M.</span>
the sale would be all finished some time before the evening
papers came out.</p>
<p>Difficulties began early. I found that it was by no
means so easy to collect advertisements, knowing, of
course, nothing about it, and I tackled the job badly.
Those who took up advertising space stipulated for an
actual distribution of ten thousand copies of the <i>Tissue</i>
each day, which had to be guaranteed and be carried out
before they paid for the advertisements. I could see no
other way out of the difficulty than to consent to their
terms. Next came how to print the <i>Tissue</i>. We had no
printing plant of our own, so we had to find what I think
they called &#8220;a job printer&#8221; to pull us through. This was
by no means easy, as I was unable to find one who would
promise that the paper would actually be printed each
day and be ready for issue at the stipulated time. Besides,
the price to be charged seemed to me to be nearly
ruinous. Yet if our venture was worth trying it was
worth paying for at first. The <i>Turf Tissue</i> was to become
a genuine daily newspaper. There would be more than
ample profits by and by.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>The time was near when the first issue was to take
place, namely, the Thursday of the week before the day
on which the Melbourne Cup was to be run, the first
Tuesday in November. We decided that the first issue
was to be given free to the newsvendors and sellers by way
of advertisement, and notices were put up inviting all such
who were willing to sell the <i>Turf Tissue</i> to assemble outside
the offices of the paper on the Thursday morning by
10 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>A.M.</span> That morning came and so did the crowds of
would-be sellers to obtain their free issue for which they
were to charge 2d. each. In such numbers were they
that the traffic was interfered with, and the police took
the matter in hand. I found out that a mistake had
undoubtedly been made in fixing the main thoroughfare
as a place of distribution, and that the mistake was
entirely due to my inexperience as an editor and newspaper
proprietor. For such I was. In a short time the
first ten thousand copies of the first number of the newly-fledged
sporting paper were being sold throughout
Melbourne town. Looking out of the window of my office
I could hear the loud cries of &#8220;Buy a <i>Turf Tissue</i>,&#8221; &#8220;All
the tips,&#8221; &#8220;Latest gallops,&#8221; &#8220;Only twopence.&#8221; All was
going well, and the firm adjourned to Scott&#8217;s Hotel. A
couple of bottles of &#8220;bubbly&#8221; christened the very first
sheet out of the printing press, which I have still.</p>
<p>To avoid the scenes in the street of that morning, I
arranged for light carts to proceed next morning to convenient
localities, where, under proper supervision, the
regular distribution to sellers would take place, and these
localities were duly and largely advertised that afternoon.</p>
<p>My two partners left me to ferret out what information
they could, particularly to spot, if possible, the winner
for the coming Saturday&#8217;s races. If we could only strike,
say, three or four winners for Saturday our fortune was
made. I looked forward to printing an issue of fifty thousand
copies on the Tuesday morning, the Cup Day, giving
the last and final and correct tip for that great race. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
treated myself to an excellent dinner at my club, and could
hardly realize that with all the disadvantages of inexperience
and want of knowledge in business matters my
success had been so quickly and soundly assured. The
first of the rather rude awakenings, which came to me
next morning, was a message sent on to the office, where
I was sitting after having supervised the departure of the
delivery carts to their several distributing localities,
arranged for on the previous day, to the effect that no
news-sellers were available at the arranged places, and
asking for instructions. I sent for a cab and started for
the places where the delivery carts were waiting. What
a change from the previous day! Either something had
gone radically wrong with the advertising of the change
in the place and mode of distribution, or else the news-sellers
had been tampered with in some way or another.
Not one was to be found. Then I remembered the agreement
with the advertisers. Ten thousand copies had to
be distributed throughout the city and suburbs. There
was only one remedy. The delivery carts must deliver
them, as widely as was possible, but, of course, free
of charge. You will doubtless have noticed that this
was the second issue of the paper which had been made
without as yet one penny having been returned to the
promoters.</p>
<p>On returning to the office I found a well-known Jew
of that day, who, I had been told, was the boss of the
news-sellers and who practically had them all in the
palm of his hand. He informed me straight out that he
had passed the word round that any vendor, man, woman
or child, who sold the <i>Turf Tissue</i> would be struck off
the list of their evening paper sellers, whom he absolutely
controlled. The explanation for the morning&#8217;s failure was
clear. But what was more clear was the unrelenting spirit
in which my visitor absolutely refused to come to any
terms which might lead to an amicable settlement. He
delivered his ultimatum like a Napoleon. He would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
no truck with new-fangled ideas which might interfere
with the sale of the old-established newspaper. He informed
me he had not the slightest ill-feeling personally
in the matter; in fact, he went so far as to say that if I
had only conferred with him before launching my scheme
he would have gladly advised me of the futility of it.
Bowing himself out, he departed. I had not the least
inclination to step over to Scott&#8217;s and have a glass of
bubbly. I simply had to count up what our losses then
amounted to. They were as follows, roughly:</p>
<p>(1) The cost of printing of the two issues by the job
printer, in addition to the cost of the paper.</p>
<p>(2) The cost of a fair distribution of ten thousand
copies daily, in order to keep faith with the advertisers.</p>
<p>(3) Our rent of the offices for three months, plus the
cost of the office accessories, lighting, etc.</p>
<p>These were all chargeable to the debit side. On the
credit side, nil. No matter how clever my sporting
confrères might be in spotting winners, we could add
not one penny to the credit side. I summoned my two
partners to a conference that afternoon. Somewhat to
my surprise they seemed cheerful. &#8220;Things are not so
bad as they look,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We have a real &#8216;dead
bird&#8217; for the Melbourne Cup. We are going to borrow
every penny we can, pledge any credit we have with the
bookmakers, and on Tuesday evening, after the race, we
shall have enough to pay our liabilities on the <i>Tissue</i> and
plenty more besides. So cheer up; just raise as much
money as you can, and we shall put it all on on Monday
evening. On the Tuesday, the morning of the race, we
will print twenty thousand copies of the <i>Tissue</i> with the
name of the winner. We will scatter the <i>Tissue</i> all over
the city and the race-course. The public will back him
for all they are worth, for he is a good horse. He may
shorten in price. If so we can lay off and stand on velvet.&#8221;</p>
<p>This cheered me up a good deal. Their confidence in
their plan was catching. So we went to Scott&#8217;s, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
all, had a bottle, and I went home, calculating what my
third share of our losses in the <i>Tissue</i> would amount
to, and how much ready cash I could lay my hands on
to back our tip so as to balance the account. I was not
the least ambitious to make a fortune. All I wanted was
to get clean clear of my journalistic enterprise and cease
to be the proprietor, editor and publisher of a newspaper.</p>
<p>I put aside my worries for the week-end. As a matter
of fact, three of our tips out of six races came off on the
Saturday, which gave the public considerable confidence
in our selection for the winner of the Cup on the Tuesday.
Then, casting sorrows to the winds, I arranged for a
quiet week-end down at Sorrento. The weather was hot;
Sorrento beach was delightful. The lapping waves on
the beach were fresh and briny; Nature smiled, and I put
worries away.</p>
<p>Then came Monday. It was the evening we were to
put our money on our horse, our pick, nay, our &#8220;dead
bird&#8221; for the Cup. We three met at the office. Our office
boy, rather a wag in his way, had decorated my office
table with flowers. My two partners, who seemed to
me to have spent the week-end without any sleep, visiting
training stables, waiting for the first streaks of dawn
to watch the early Sunday and Monday morning gallops,
and doing all that is expected of racing touts, were more
than convinced of the certainty of their choice. There was
nothing in it but &#8220;Mata.&#8221; &#8220;Mata&#8221; could not be beaten.
The race was all over. &#8220;Mata,&#8221; however, was at a short
price, and I could see it would require a good deal of
money to enable me to get round my share of our losses.
Still, what was the use of all our exertions and hard work
and financial risks if the two partners specially selected
for their intimate knowledge of the true form of the horses
were not to be believed? There was nothing for it but
to sink or swim together. We duly published the <i>Tissue</i>
on the Tuesday morning, the Cup morning. By a quarter
past ten you could pick up a copy of the <i>Tissue</i> anywhere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
in the city. We sent cabs full of them to Flemington
and scattered them all over the road and the course.
Every one was saying &#8220;Mata&#8221; would win all right.</p>
<p>The Melbourne Cup was run that afternoon, and Mata
did <i>not</i> win. As a matter of fact, he was one of the two
last horses to finish. Grand Flaneur won&mdash;our tip for a
place. All was up with the <i>Turf Tissue</i>. Nothing was
left but for myself and my two partners to try to look
happy and pay our responsibilities. I attended the office
on the Wednesday, but my partners did not turn up, as
I expected. I found out afterwards that they had lost their
all, and that, as I had undertaken the financial responsibilities
of the venture, it was left to me to have the pleasure
of winding up our company&#8217;s affairs. I had in this respect
to stand a great deal of good-natured chaff from my
friends and General Scratchley, who thought it was quite
a good joke.</p>
<p>I am reminded that years afterwards the following
amusing incident occurred in Melbourne. The Melbourne
Cup of 1896 was to take place. Some two months before
the race the Duke of the Abruzzi, cousin of the King of
Italy, then a young man and a sailor, arrived in Adelaide
on an Italian man-of-war. He was making a tour round
the world. I saw a good deal of him during his stay
in Adelaide. I was then Commandant of South Australia.
The duke was much interested in the Cup, and he was
most anxious to get a good tip. A mare called Auraria,
belonging to Mr. David James, of Adelaide, was in the
race. She was a good mare, and a good deal fancied
for the race by the talent in Adelaide. She had, at any
rate, an outside show. So I suggested to the duke and
his staff to put some money on, as the odds against her
at the time were about thirty to one, and if she improved
before the day of the race that price was sure to shorten and
they could lay off. He made me write the name &#8220;Auraria&#8221;
in his notebook, so that he wouldn&#8217;t forget. He continued
his tour, and I had forgotten the incident. Later on I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
was in Melbourne, staying with Lord Hopetoun for the
Cup carnival. I had backed Auraria myself, hoping to
lay off. However, when the day came, nobody wanted to
back her. As a matter of fact, you could get forty to one
about her as the horses went to the post. The race started.
Coming up the straight it was an open race. When they
got to the distance the crowd yelled the names of several
horses as the winners. At the half distance there came a
regular roar. &#8220;Auraria, Auraria wins!&#8221; A few seconds
more and Auraria was first past the post.</p>
<p>After the race we went to afternoon tea with their
Excellencies. The room was full, but there were only one
or two of us winners, when one of the A.D.C.s told His
Excellency that the Duke of the Abruzzi was just outside
and he had asked him to come in. In he came, with
two of his staff, full of smiles, rushed towards His Excellency
and said, &#8220;Look! I backed Auraria. We&#8221;&mdash;he
pointed to his A.D.C.&mdash;&#8220;backed Auraria. We each
win £160. Look! All here in our pockets,&#8221; which were
bulging with gold and notes. And, turning round to
the admiring crowd, he suddenly saw me. In a moment
he was embracing me with both arms round my neck,
saying, &#8220;Auraria, my friend! The beautiful Adelaide
Auraria.&#8221; He then explained that it had been mere chance
that he had been enabled to leave Sydney the night
before, and had arrived at Flemington race-course just
in time for the race, and they had backed Auraria with
the cash bookmakers, obtaining the useful odds of forty
to one. He then pulled out his pocket-book and said,
&#8220;You see the name &#8216;Auraria&#8217;? You wrote it for me in
Adelaide. I came to put my money on. It is splendid.&#8221;
And so it was.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>A MERCHANT, THEN AN ACTOR</h3>
</div>

<p>Well, something else had to be done to recover my
losses and fill in time. Having the offices on my hands&mdash;for
I had taken them on a three months&#8217; lease&mdash;it
struck me that if I became a commission agent, and if
I secured something good to sell, I might make some
money.</p>
<p>So I decided to interview several firms in the exhibition
with a view to becoming their agent. My first endeavours
met with what I thought was considerable success. They
were mostly foreign firms that I approached, as I am a
good linguist, and they appeared to be delighted to have
my services as their agent. Amongst them, I remember,
was a German firm which had quite a wonderful turning
lathe which could turn out table legs, ornamental posts,
banisters for staircases, and in fact all sorts of wooden
legs and posts, in marvellous quick time. Then there
was an American firm with a very reliable and still cheap
line of watches, and so on. But I was not made aware
that these firms had already imported large stocks of their
particular goods and were selling them on their own
account, so that there were not many opportunities left
of doing further business for the time being. In the
meantime I spent quite a fair sum of money in advertising
their goods, for which, no doubt, they were inwardly
thankful.</p>
<p>Sitting in my office one day I had a visit from a
gentleman, who asked me if I would act as agent for
what he informed me was a sure and good line to sell.
I told him it depended on what it was. To my surprise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
he said, &#8220;Yorkshire hams.&#8221; I looked at him, wondering
whether he was all right in the head. He noticed my
hesitation in answering him, but said:</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. The position is this. I am closely in
touch with many of the boats arriving in harbour from
England. Most of them are now bringing certain
quantities of Yorkshire hams by way of a little speculation
amongst some of the ship&#8217;s company. Knowing most
of them, they have asked me if I could place their hams.
I have no time myself to do so, but I thought a firm
like yours would take it on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it didn&#8217;t appear to me there was any harm in
selling &#8220;Yorkshire hams&#8221; and getting a good commission
out of them, and, at any rate, there were always
people who would eat &#8220;Yorkshire hams,&#8221; and if the
market wasn&#8217;t glutted they could soon be disposed of.
The terms of my commission were fixed up, and my
visitor undertook to start delivering the hams at the offices
in a couple of days. I may tell you that there was a
back entrance to the offices from a side street, and as
the offices were fairly large, one room was set aside for
the storage of the hams. It was to be his business to
deliver them and store them. We began operations at
once, and I succeeded in getting orders fairly easily. I
discovered afterwards that the reason of this was that my
price was lower than the actual market price. Having
no previous experience in selling hams, and, as a matter
of fact, of selling anything, I had no suspicion that there
might be something wrong in connexion with the business.
I just kept on selling hams as long as there were
any available.</p>
<p>Things were looking up, I thought. If I could only
get people to buy a few legs for tables, and banisters for
their staircases, good old-fashioned four-poster beds, and
some of the other goods for which I was presumably
agent, business would look up and a fair start would
be made.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>But Nemesis was again after me. I received a visit
one morning from a gentleman I knew quite well. He
was, as a matter of fact, one of the senior Customs officers.
He was very nice, but he advised me to give up selling
hams. It appeared that these very good hams were all
being smuggled, and found their way up to my offices
by all manner of means, sometimes in cabs, sometimes
in sacks on wheelbarrows, and that consequently I was
taking part in a transaction which duly qualified me for
a heavy fine, in addition to a somewhat healthy term of
imprisonment. So my friend the Customs House officer,
who was quite aware that I was innocent of fraud and
had no knowledge of what was going on, had come round
to warn me. He hoped, he said, very soon to get hold
of the kind gentleman who had been good enough to
introduce the business to me. Well, there was nothing
to be done but &#8220;Hands off hams,&#8221; and as I had been a
commission agent then for some six weeks, and the only
merchandise I had sold was &#8220;the hams,&#8221; I considered
it high time to close the business, in case I might let
myself in for something more serious.</p>
<p>Just about this time the notorious bushranger, Ned
Kelly, who had been captured close to Benalla, Victoria,
was sentenced to death, and he was to be hanged at the
Melbourne Jail at eight o&#8217;clock one morning.</p>
<p>I felt a certain amount of curiosity. I thought it would
be an unique experience to witness his execution. I was a
personal friend of the chief magistrate of the city, and
besides, having arranged with one or two New Zealand
papers to communicate to them any matters which might
be of interest during my stay in Australia, I could obtain
permission to be present at the execution as a representative
of the Press. The White Hart Hotel was not far distant
from the jail.</p>
<p>I did not feel in the least happy the afternoon before
the morning of the execution, when a permit to be present
was handed to me by a police officer. My dinner that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
night seemed to disagree with me, and I went to my
bed feeling that I was about to witness a scene that was
more than likely to leave such impressions in my mind
as I would probably regret for the rest of my life. However,
it had to be done. I was up early after a sleepless
and restless night, and then walked to the jail. I arrived
at the big entrance gates, the sad and solemn entrance
to the forbidding-looking building, about ten minutes to
eight in the morning. Around those gates a large crowd
had congregated.</p>
<p>There was not a sound to be heard from that crowd.
There was dead silence. I made my way to those big
entrance gates. A small wicket gate with a bell-rope
attached was in front of me. I pulled the bell-rope. The
little door was quietly opened. Just at the moment a
cab arrived, and three men stepped out. Naturally thinking
they were officials connected with the execution, I
stood aside to let them pass through the little door. I
noticed that one of them seemed to be somewhat under
the influence of drink. They passed on into the confines
of the jail. I then asked the gatekeeper who those men
were. He said, &#8220;That one is the hangman.&#8221; He was
the one whom I had noticed. My wish, or my intention
rather, to step inside those gates vanished. I thanked
the gatekeeper and told him that I would not trouble him
to let me through. The little door was then shut, and I
was more than glad to remain outside. I became one
of that silent crowd who waited outside the gates. It was
some twenty minutes afterwards that the black flag was
hoisted on the building. The full penalty of the law had
been paid by Ned Kelly.</p>
<p>I dare say many of those who read this may have
seen exhibited the iron case which Kelly wore over his
head at the time of his capture, and on which the dents
of two or three bullets which had struck it when he had
been captured were plainly visible.</p>
<p>I had now been, as you see, really hard at work for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
over two months, so I thought I was entitled to a holiday;
for there appeared to be no probability of the appointment
for which I was waiting being made just then.</p>
<p>It was Christmas time, very hot, so the seaside was
the place to go to, and I selected Geelong&mdash;why, I know
not. I was there but a few days when I was introduced
to some residents whose business was that of wool broking.
We had several mutual friends.</p>
<p>I had told them that I had not been very successful
in my business enterprises, and after two or three days
they were good enough to offer me a position in their
offices. I thanked them very much and left Geelong, as
I was afraid that if I started business again so soon after
my late experiences I might get into further difficulties.</p>
<p>But, as a matter of fact, the real reason of my refusing
their offer was that what I almost looked upon as a divine
inspiration had come to me in the meantime. Why should
the experiences I had gained while managing the Royal
Artillery Theatre at Woolwich for one whole week be
lost to the world, and particularly to Australia? I had
been manager for that week, and I had been one of the
stars of the company. Why, of course, it would be
criminal not to give the Melbourne public the opportunity
to judge of my capabilities as an actor. So, on a Monday
midday I called at the Bijou Theatre, Bourke Street, of
which the lessee was Mr. Wybert Reeve, who was running
his own company and playing at that time <i>The Woman
in White</i>. He was a good, sound, old-fashioned actor.
I interviewed him in his sanctum and told him that I
was anxious to go on the stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you acted before?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; I said, quite in a lordly way; and I told
him of my experiences at Woolwich. He was not in
the least impressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What salary do you expect?&#8221; he then asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think that four pounds a week would be a
fair commencement,&#8221; I answered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>You should have seen the expression on his face. He
looked at me for a few moments in silence, and then
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, good gracious! Do you know that I was
acting nearly five years before I earned a pound a week?
And you want to begin with four pounds a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, &#8220;you must have begun a considerable
number of years ago. Times change. Besides, I have
some very excellent clothes, and they are surely worth
something in their way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, he laughed, for he appeared to have been somewhat
favourably impressed by what he no doubt considered
my impertinence and self-conceit, and told me
that at the moment his company was full, but that if I
left him my address he would communicate with me
as soon as an opportunity arose.</p>
<p>On the very next Thursday afternoon I received a note
from him at the old White Hart Hotel, asking me if I
would call upon him as soon as convenient. I arrived there
at seven that evening, and found him waiting for me in
his dressing-room, where he was preparing to make up
for his part as Count Fosco, in which he had been quite
a success. He opened the conversation by asking me
if I was prepared to take on the part of Careless in <i>The
School for Scandal</i>, which he had advertised to produce
on the Saturday night next. He explained that the artist
whom he had engaged for the part had been missing
for two days, and, from what he had gathered, even if
he presented himself at the theatre, it was more than
doubtful if he would be in a fit condition to appear before
the public.</p>
<p>The proposition was a difficult one. To study the part
in two days, appearing in it on the evening of the second
day, without an opportunity of rehearsal, would be a
bold venture for one who was setting forth to earn fame
and a high reputation as an actor. I thought for a
moment or two. I remembered that I had seen <i>The</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
<i>School for Scandal</i> played once or twice in my life. My
recollections of the part of Careless were that he was a
somewhat light-hearted, jovial, easy-going person, whose
life was a pleasure to him, and who did not take too serious
a view of the things in this world. Well, was I not,
at that moment, in a position when I might with advantage
take on the mantle of Careless&#8217;s temperament and
chance the result? Yes; I consented. Wybert was evidently
relieved. He told me afterwards, in confidence, that
he so admired what he considered my consummate self-confidence
that he decided to give me the opportunity,
subject to an informal rehearsal to be held on the next
day, Friday, in the afternoon. I then inquired whether
Careless&#8217;s costume would be ready for me. A serious
look came over his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; he said, &#8220;the Careless that&#8217;s missing is
only about five foot nine. It&#8217;s quite impossible to put
your six feet two inches into his clothes. What&#8217;s to be
done? Can you get them made in time?&#8221;</p>
<p>I relieved his mind by telling him that, as good fortune
would have it, I had been at a fancy dress ball at a
friend&#8217;s house in Toorak just ten days before, and that
a friend of mine, who was private secretary to one of
the then Governors of Australia, and who was about
my height and build, had appeared at the ball as Careless,
and his costume was a particularly handsome one. I had
no doubt if I asked him he would lend it to me. Once
more the smile came across his face. He looked at me
for a bit and then remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to think honestly that you&#8217;re pulling
my leg all the time. Say so, if you are; otherwise I shall
postpone the production of <i>The School for Scandal</i> and
continue <i>The Woman in White</i> for another week.&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt sorry for a moment that he had considered me
to have been somewhat flippant. I had no doubt he had
some right to think so, so I very sincerely and seriously
told him that such a thing as pulling anybody&#8217;s leg had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
never entered my mind. Indeed, very far from it; that
my experience since I had been in Melbourne was exactly
the opposite, and that it was I who had suffered much
from having my leg pulled by other people, especially
those commercial magnates whose business I had been
so anxious to promote. My explanation seemed to please
him. There was one more point which required arranging,
and an important point too, and that was whether my
salary would be four pounds a week or not. So I asked
him. He answered very readily that if he was satisfied
with the results of the rehearsal next day, and in view
of the fact that I was finding my own wardrobe, and that
an expensive one, he would pay the four pounds a week.
I at once thought to myself that I had made a mistake.
I was giving myself away too cheap, but I would keep
it in mind for our next business interview. I did remember,
as you will see presently.</p>
<p>Friday afternoon came, and, as the stage was occupied
in preparing the new scenery for <i>The School for Scandal</i>,
we held a so-called rehearsal in one of the corridors. It
was very informal, but I had mastered my book. Wybert
closed on our bargain, and the comedy was produced on
the Saturday night before a very large, select and enthusiastic
audience, amongst whom there seemed to be
an inordinate number of my own personal friends. All
went well. I had made up my mind to succeed or go
right down under. I was in a very happy mood. My
friend the private secretary&#8217;s clothes fitted me to perfection,
and, to the astonishment not only of Wybert Reeve
himself, the company, and the professional critics in front,
I introduced at times some light dancing steps, which
cheered me on in my efforts and apparently highly pleased
our audience. Between the acts Wybert took the opportunity,
while encouraging me, to suggest that it would
be an awful pity to spoil the splendid work I was putting
in, as he called it, by overdoing it. I could see how
anxious he was. I opened a good bottle of champagne,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
we had a drink together, and I assured him that all would
be well. And so it was; and at the end of the performance
we answered repeated calls before the curtain.
When we had made our last bows to the audience, the company
met in what was then an old institution at the back
of the scenes, namely, the green-room, where Wybert
himself insisted on opening the champagne and was no
longer anxious as to how many glasses we drank to the
success of <i>The School for Scandal</i>.</p>
<p>Sunday was a happy day. I spent it with some friends
near Point Cook, at Port Phillip Bay, which spot, years
afterwards, I selected to establish the first aviation school
in Australia. Most of the country in that district belonged
to the Chirnside family, the first of whom had made
good in the early days of the Colony of Victoria. Werribee
House was their headquarters. So had the Clarkes
made good, the Manifolds, the Blacks and many others
whom in after years I had to thank for much kindness
and hospitality.</p>
<p>On the Monday, which was known amongst actors
as Treasury morning, I duly attended Wybert&#8217;s office to
collect my first hard-earned wage. It had been arranged
that, though my engagement dated only from the previous
Thursday, I would be entitled to a week&#8217;s wages if all
was well on the opening night. I was as contented as
anyone could be, for I knew I had made good. The two
leading morning papers had most favourable notices, the
production was a success, and even Careless had been
favourably commented on by them. I duly received four
golden sovereigns. I felt this was a much better line of
business than editing sporting newspapers or selling hams
and table legs.</p>
<p>But I was remembering the fact, yes, that I had
asked for too low a salary, and that having come out
on top I was entitled to more money. How much was
it to be? I bethought to myself that a rise of two pounds
would not be an extravagant request, taking everything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
into consideration. So, after thanking Wybert, I informed
him that I could not think of continuing in the play unless
he raised my salary to six pounds a week. He was cross,
I could see, and he also pretended to be hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you make such a request after the chance
I have given you? It is preposterous. I am surprised
at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I agree with you as far as being
surprised. I am surprised myself. And it would never
do for you to lose another Careless within a week, and
unless I get the extra two pounds a week I might be lost
to-night myself.&#8221; The idea of such a happening seemed
to strike him as possible. He hesitated; then he gave in,
and my salary was fixed at six pounds a week, but, more
than that, he took me on at that rate for a term of six
weeks. I practically became a real live member of his
company, and was to be ready to play any part from
Hamlet to an imbecile old butler in a fool of a farce, if
asked to do so. I was not downhearted. I felt I could
play anything. The six weeks passed only too quickly.
Wybert produced three other plays within that time, and
then came the end of his lease and the breaking up
of our company.</p>
<p>Our leading lady was Madame le Grand, who, I think,
was (or had been) Mrs. Kyrle Bellew in private life. Mr.
Ireland was one of our leading men, the father of that
gifted young actress, Miss Harry Ireland. Maggie Oliver,
an irrepressible and most clever soubrette, was ever
happy and a source of pleasure to us all. Old Daniels,
a Jew, was the funny man. He was a first-rate low
comedian who never overdid his part. Then there was
Hans Phillips, a polished actor, who, I think, married
the daughter of Gordon, then the best scenic painter in
Australia. Poor Hans Phillips unfortunately died at a
comparatively early age. Then I remember those two
charming sisters, Constance and Alice Deorwyn, who afterwards
became, one, Mrs. Stewart, and the other Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
Holloway, the mother of another charming young actress,
Beatrice Holloway.</p>
<p>During this time I was introduced to, and became intimate
with, many of the leading managers and actors
in Australia. There was Coppin, the doyen of the profession.
Maggie Moore and her husband, J. C. Williamson,
had &#8220;struck oil.&#8221; The four Stewart Sisters were
at their best. In a pantomime the youngest of them,
Nelly, then only about sixteen, was bewitching her many
admirers, singing &#8220;For he wore a penny paper collar
round his throat,&#8221; and dancing like a sylph. What a
favourite she became, and how for many years she continued
to be at the top of her profession, all Australia
knows. Who that saw her can forget her as Sweet Nell,
and who that had had the pleasure of knowing her but
thinks of her, not as &#8220;Sweet Nell of Old Drury,&#8221; but as
Sweet Nellie Stewart herself.</p>
<p>The friendships I made then have lasted till death
has intervened. During the many years I spent in
Australia I counted many shining lights of the theatrical
profession as close personal friends&mdash;and I do so now.
Violet Loraine was the last. At the end of my first and
short engagement we got up a benefit on behalf of the two
Deorwyn sisters.</p>
<p>The opening piece was a farce named <i>Turn Him Out</i>,
in which I played the leading part, Eglantine Roseleaf.
This was my last public appearance as a professional
actor.</p>
<p>An event happened which put an end to any reasons
why I should stay in Victoria awaiting the military appointment
which had been promised me. The finances of the
colony were in a low state, retrenchment was imperative,
and the Premier, Graham Berry, set to work to carry it
out with a heavy hand. The public services suffered
heavily, and amongst them the military vote heaviest of
all. Instead of any new military appointment being made,
a large percentage of the officers serving were retrenched.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
I felt bitterly disappointed, but I could not blame my
friend, General Scratchley; in fact I could not blame
anybody.</p>
<p>My friends, or at least some of them, advised me to
continue my theatrical efforts. They even offered me a
tempting rise on my last salary and fairly long engagements,
but I was in no way keen. I had tried it only
as an experiment, and the ways of the theatre were not
alluring to me, and especially after having gone through
them personally. There is a good deal of fun to be got
out of it, but few people know how hard one has to work,
and what a slave to duty one has to become in order to
rise to the top of the tree.</p>
<p>There was nothing for it now but to return home. I
said good-bye to all my friends and left for Adelaide,
South Australia, en route for Scotland.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>AS POLICEMAN IN ADELAIDE</h3>
</div>

<p>On arrival at Adelaide I called on the Governor of South
Australia, then Sir William Jervois, the distinguished
Engineer officer, who, with General Scratchley in Melbourne,
was advising the Australian Colonies with regard
to the land defences. As I was shown into the private
secretary&#8217;s room I was more than surprised to meet his
son, Captain John Jervois, who had been a cadet at the
Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, with me. We had
a long chat. I told him of my varied experiences, some
of which naturally amused him much.</p>
<p>His father, the Governor, happened to be away, but
he said he would arrange for me to see him the next day.
Next morning I received a message from him to say that
his father would be glad to see me, and would I lunch
with them? I did so, and after lunch His Excellency,
Sir William, asked me to his study. His son had told
him all about me. Sir William informed me that one of
the forts which he had designed for South Australia,
Fort Glanville, had just been completed, that it had become
necessary to raise a small artillery unit to man it,
and that he thought I was just the man to raise and
command it.</p>
<p>I must say I couldn&#8217;t help smiling. I suggested to
him whether, in view of my experiences as regarded
appointments, he really thought that I ought to accept his
very kind offer. He said &#8220;Certainly; go and see the
commandant&#8221;&mdash;General Downes, R.A. &#8220;I have already
had a chat with him about you. Talk it over with him
and let me know what you decide. In the meantime go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
and see the Chief Commissioner of Police, Mr. George
Hamilton, who lives at the Adelaide Club, and who will
do all he can to make you comfortable.&#8221; The result of
my interview with the general was that I decided to stay
on in the hopes of obtaining the appointment. He
promised to recommend me for it.</p>
<p>Later on in the day I called upon Mr. George Hamilton
at the Adelaide Club. He was a charming personality,
well advanced in years. He was kindness itself to me,
and put me up as an honorary member of the club. He
told me that on the next day, which was the last day of
the month, he would be making his usual monthly inspection
of the mounted and foot police attached to the
city of Adelaide. The police barracks were situated not
far from the club, on the other side of North Terrace and
beyond the Government House grounds. The front portion
of the building was being utilized as the Military Staff
Office. It was a peculiarity of the mounted police in
Adelaide that they were all mounted on grey horses, Mr.
George Hamilton being of the opinion that the police
force was intended more to prevent crime than to punish
criminals. He held that mounted policemen on grey or
white horses would be seen at a greater distance, and
recognized as such, better than if they were mounted on
horses of other colours, and their presence being quicker
recognized, would act as a deterrent to crime if such was
premeditated. I accompanied him on his inspection, and
that small force, mounted and foot, was a credit to South
Australia.</p>
<p>I had been thinking seriously to myself, during the
inspection, as to what I was to do while waiting for my
appointment. It occurred to me that I had exhausted
most means of making a livelihood that I knew of, and I
recognized the fact that I could not afford to let the days
go by without making some money to meet my living
expenses. Walking back to the club after the inspection,
I asked the Commissioner what were the pay and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
emoluments of a mounted police trooper. &#8220;Eight shillings
and sixpence a day,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is their pay, free quarters,
free uniform and travelling allowance while on duty necessitating
more than four hours&#8217; absence from the barracks.&#8221;
Considering that the pay of a lieutenant of the Royal
Artillery was somewhere about six and fourpence a day
and no emoluments, the lot of a mounted policeman
seemed a happy one. I straight away asked Mr. Hamilton
whether he would take me into the force. He seemed
very surprised, but I assured him I was quite in earnest.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there is a vacancy, but before I can
promise you anything you must talk the matter over with
His Excellency the Governor, and take his advice.&#8221; His
Excellency thought it was quite a good idea, and informed
me that I was to tell the Commissioner that he would be
very pleased if I was taken on. So it was arranged that
I should join up on the seventh of the month.</p>
<p>By this time I had been introduced to most of the
members of the club and some of their families. But it
was quite evident that if I was to become a policeman I
couldn&#8217;t remain at the club, nor could I be on visiting
terms with the élite of Adelaide. I therefore made up my
mind to be a policeman, a real policeman, and give up
social festivities for the time being. This decision met
with the full approval of His Excellency and the general,
and, I need hardly say, of the Commissioner. The only
exceptions to this rule were that I would occasionally
lunch at Government House and at the General&#8217;s home
when convenient. I duly joined, and, remembering my
New Zealand experience, I swore to myself that I was not
going to resign until after being duly appointed to my
next billet.</p>
<p>It is not to be wondered at that not only the corporal in
charge of the barracks, but the mounted troopers under
his charge, were surprised to see the Commissioner&#8217;s
young friend, who had been inspecting them a few days
before, joining their ranks. Only the mounted police were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
quartered at the barracks, the foot police lived privately
in their respective districts and suburbs. I spent my
first night in the barrack-room, and I was glad to find
that amongst the twenty-five or thereabouts of the number
of troopers, no less than six or seven were ex-officers or
N.C. officers of the army or navy, and the remainder were
men who had been selected from the pick of the many
candidates who were continually offering their services to
the Commissioner.</p>
<p>A word about the corporal in charge&mdash;Corporal Campbell,
an ex-salt, a hard-headed, kind-hearted Scotsman.
Corporal Campbell had to his credit some thirty-five years
of mounted police work in South Australia. The greater
number of those years he had spent in the northern districts
of the then young colony. In those early days the
duties of the mounted police in the far-off, unsettled
districts were more than serious. They lived away from
civilization, supervising huge tracts of country, necessitating
travelling hundreds of miles at a stretch across
uninhabited country, lacking in food and water. It required
men of iron constitution and iron will to perform
their duties. It wanted even more; it wanted self-confidence
and a thorough knowledge of their work to deal
equitably with the many points of dispute that from time
to time arose between the settlers and the native tribes.
Practically the mounted trooper was a magistrate. It was
up to the mounted trooper to make all preliminary inquiries
not only into criminal charges, but in many cases
into civil disputes. Having done so it was up to him to
prepare the cases for the justice of the peace before whose
jurisdiction those cases had to be submitted.</p>
<p>The justices of the peace were men selected because
they happened to hold some interest in the district. What
knowledge had they of the law? What experience had
they ever had of sitting as magistrates? Generally none.
Consequently the justices of the peace leant for support
on the mounted constables. It is to the credit of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
mounted police of Australia, right throughout the whole
of it, in every colony, that within my recollection, covering
many years, I do not remember a single case of any
serious complaint against the force of mis-direction in
advising the magistrates when asked to do so.</p>
<p>While I had made up my mind to give up all social
festivities, I reserved to myself one privilege, so that
occasionally I could be reminded of my old social days.
Perhaps my choice was guided by my success in the
theatrical profession. I took a seat in the theatre in what
was the best part of the house, next to the club box, for
every Friday night. I used to treat myself to a good
dinner in one of the hotels, all alone, and then went forth
to enjoy the play. Adelaide at that time possessed only
one really first-class theatre, the Theatre Royal, in Hindley
Street. On these Friday nights I used to meet my men
friends, but I did not allow myself to have the pleasure of
meeting their lady friends. I was a policeman, and a
policeman I had to be. It was really quite quaint. Everybody
knew me; they all knew who I was. But it was
obviously up to me to play the game.</p>
<p>A pleasing surprise awaited me the Monday morning
following the day I joined. Corporal Campbell informed
me that the then drill instructor who supervised the riding
school and the instruction in sword and carbine exercises,
musketry and revolver practice, had sent in his resignation,
as he was going to get married and had decided to
open an hotel in the flourishing district on the Mount
Lofty ranges, at the foot of which the city of Adelaide is
situated. He further told me that I had been appointed
drill instructor in his place, and that the rank of acting-corporal
had been conferred on me. This was indeed
quick promotion. Besides, it carried with it many privileges.
In the first place I could have a room to myself
instead of sleeping in one of the barrack-rooms; secondly,
I was off routine duties, such as serving summonses,
investigating offences against the Police Act, and doing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
night patrol duties. My daily pay was raised to ten
shillings and twopence a day, but I had to share with
Corporal Campbell the responsibility of being in charge of
the barracks. My short experience in the North Island
of New Zealand stood me in good stead. My knowledge
of military law and procedure came in most useful, as it
naturally comprised an intimate acquaintance with the
rules of evidence, most necessary in the preparation of
police-court cases. I felt that I was fairly qualified
to take on my new duties without any misgivings.
Besides, Corporal Campbell kindly offered to coach me in
carrying on the discipline and economic duties in connexion
with the barracks, and the official correspondence
with the Commissioner&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>One of the privileges of the drill instructor was to have
his horse attended to by one of the troopers. I did not
avail myself of this.</p>
<p>A young horse, rising four, had just been bought, one
of the handsomest dappled greys I had ever seen, standing
about fifteen hands three, full of breeding. I selected
him for my mount, and determined to look after him
myself. Cold work it was too in the early winter mornings
to wash him down, groom him and keep the saddlery and
accoutrements in order. I schooled him myself, and he
promised to become a perfect hack and police horse. A
police horse needs to be taught the best of manners. He
must be thoroughly quiet, good tempered, and capable of
being ridden in amongst a crowd without being frightened.
I succeeded beyond my expectations in training him, and I
was very pleased that he was turning out so well. After
about two months, however, he rapidly developed the
worst of habits. Suddenly, without any apparent reason,
he would stop and refuse to move. He would do this
anywhere, on a country road or in the middle of the street.
It was no use plying the whip, or using a powerful spur.
He would not go forward. He would rear, or
lash out with his hind legs, but he would not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
move on. This happened only very occasionally, but,
when it did, it was most awkward, especially if I
was in charge of an escort, or on a ceremonial parade.
It turned out that he was suffering from a sort of horse-mania
produced by having fed when young on a plant
known in the district, where he was bred, as the Darling
Pea. Feeding on this plant had this extraordinary effect
upon horses. I was returning one day, after being on
duty at the races at Victoria Park, to the barracks. As
I was passing the Adelaide Hospital he stopped dead.
After a few moments of gentle persuasion I gave him a
sharp touch with my spurs. He reared straight up and
fell backwards on the road. Luckily my face escaped
injury, but my chest and back were nearly flattened out.
A few days in hospital put me all right, and I returned
to duty. He chose a fit place to hurt me.</p>
<p>The overland railway to Melbourne was then being
constructed, and a very large railway camp was established
in the Mount Lofty ranges, near a place called Aldgate.
In this camp were congregated all classes and conditions
of men, of several nationalities. I was in charge of the
barracks one evening when a report came in from the foot
police station that a girl had been nearly murdered. She
had been found in the backyard of a small house in a disreputable
quarter of the city, with her throat cut and a
dagger wound in her breast. The nature of the wound
pointed to the attempted murder being the work of a
foreigner, probably an Italian, of whom there was a considerable
number at the railway camp. I at once ordered
all the available troopers out to make the necessary inquiries
in the city and suburbs, and decided to proceed
myself direct to the railway camp at Aldgate.</p>
<p>Having a fair knowledge of the language I thought I
might pick up some valuable information on the way if
I met any of the Italians. I started about 10.30 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>P.M.</span>,
dressed as an ordinary bushman, riding an old bay horse
which we kept for these occasions, and my revolver hidden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
but handy. The distance to the camp at Aldgate was
about eighteen miles, taking short cuts with which I had
already become acquainted.</p>
<p>I pulled up at several public houses on the road in
the hopes of picking up some clue. I failed till I reached
a well-known hotel, the Eagle-on-the-Hill, roughly half-way
to Aldgate. The landlord, whom I had to wake up,
and whom I knew, told me that he had served with drinks,
amongst others, two foreigners, who had ridden up on one
horse, and who said they were on the way to the camp.
They had evidently had a good deal of drink; he had
given them some more, and they had managed to climb
on to the horse again and had ridden away. He could
not, however, tell me what nationality they were. This
had taken place about 11 o&#8217;clock, <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>P.M.</span> It was now about
1 o&#8217;clock, <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>A.M.</span> The two men would be at the camp about
this time. I could reach it comfortably about 3 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>A.M.</span> I
got no further information until I arrived at the camp.
I had hoped to make my entry quietly at that time of
the morning, but I was disappointed. I had hardly got
near the tents on the left of the road when a whole troop
of mongrels commenced to bark furiously. I could not
get into the camp without being seen, as I had hoped.
However, I found my way, after inquiries, to where the
man in charge lived.</p>
<p>When I had satisfied him as to who I was and on what
business I was bent, he put his services at my disposal at
once. I told him I wanted if possible to get hold of two
men who had ridden up on one horse, that they were
foreigners, and I suspected Italians. To my joy he told
me that he had several men he could depend on who kept
an eye on the camp generally for him, both by day and
night, and one of them might have noticed their arrival,
as the dogs were almost certain to have greeted them in
the same way as they had greeted me, especially if the
horse they were riding had come up to the tents.</p>
<p>He asked me to go with him while he made his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
inquiries. The first man he roused up did not know anything
about the matter. The second, however, did. He
had been late himself getting home, and curiously enough
the two men on the horse had passed him on the road
about a couple of miles before reaching the camp. It was a
moonlight night, and he had noticed they were pretty
drunk, hardly being able to hold on to the horse. As
they passed him they called out to him, and he recognized
them as two Italians who were engaged in tunnelling, bad
characters, red-hot tempered, but good workers when
sober. This was indeed a piece of luck. I asked him if
he could guide me to their tent. That was more difficult.
He was not sure; but he knew where the ganger who
was in charge of the tunnelling party hung out, and he
would probably know their whereabouts.</p>
<p>I went back to where I had left my horse, got a
pair of handcuffs I had brought with me, and took one
of the stirrup leathers off my saddle. When I returned
the ganger had been found and took us towards the
portion of the camp where the two men shared one of the
dirtiest of tents I had ever seen. By this time dawn was
just breaking. I arranged with the ganger&mdash;he was a
good sort&mdash;that on arrival at the tent I would go inside
and would hold the two of them up. As they would be
most probably in a heavy sleep this would be a simple
matter. Then, having handcuffed one, I would make
secure the other one&#8217;s hands behind his back with the
stirrup leather and march them off to Adelaide; but in
case anything went wrong inside and I called out he was
to rush in to my help. He agreed. I slipped out my revolver,
asked the ganger to hold up the lantern he was
carrying so that I could see inside the tent when I opened
the tattered flap, and, raising it, slipped inside. I had to
stoop nearly double, the tent being very low, and I could
just see with the aid of the ganger&#8217;s lantern.</p>
<p>A more filthy place is difficult to imagine. On very
low stretchers covered with rags by way of bedclothes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
lay the two men, one on each side of me, with their heads
towards the entrance to the tent. They were sleeping
heavily. I turned first towards the man on my right and
suddenly dropped heavily on him with my right knee on
his chest, and before he awoke to his senses I had him
handcuffed. I turned over to the other one, who was just
trying to sit up, apparently dazed. I threw the stirrup
leather, the end of which I had passed through the buckle,
making a noose of it, over his head, and pulling at the end
of it with all my might, I backed out of the tent, dragging
him after me. It was all done in a minute, and I had
them both bagged. The ganger was quite delighted as he
took hold of the stirrup leather to make the man secure
while I went in to pull out his handcuffed mate. This
was easily done under the persuasion of my revolver.</p>
<p>By the time they were both outside the tent they were
wide awake. We made them sit on the ground. I handed
the revolver to the ganger and left them in his charge
while I searched their filthy abode. I was quite rewarded.
Underneath some rags which had served as a pillow to
the handcuffed man I found a knife with a blade about
five inches long by some three-quarters of an inch broad,
such as is much in use amongst Italians. It was covered
with blood, some of which had not quite dried up. I also
picked up a dirty woollen comforter which he had evidently
worn the night before and on which were blood-stains
of very recent date. I was satisfied; I found nothing
more of any value as evidence. My job was done; all
that was left was to escort my two prisoners to Adelaide.</p>
<p>It was now daylight. As there had been no noise few
of the early risers who came slouching out of their tents
knew that any arrest had been made until we were nearly
out of the camp, and they took but little notice. I thanked
the man in charge and the ganger for their assistance,
and, after partaking of some coffee at the little cottage
where the man in charge lived, I started off with my two
prisoners tied together, making for an hotel not far off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
where I knew I could obtain a vehicle to drive them down
to Adelaide. I arrived in Adelaide all well, and by two
o&#8217;clock they were quickly and safely locked up in the
police station. They were duly charged and tried. The
girl had recovered from her injuries, and the culprit
escaped with a long term of imprisonment instead of being
hanged; the other received a short sentence. My first
attempt to hunt down criminals had come off satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Shortly after I had joined the police my good friend,
Mr. George Hamilton, retired from his position and Mr.
Peterswald was appointed Commissioner. Mr. Peterswald,
having been Mr. Hamilton&#8217;s right-hand man, was
thoroughly fitted for the appointment. He held it for many
years, during which time the efficiency of the police force
of South Australia was well maintained. As Commissioner
I personally received from him during the time I
was in the force every consideration. We had become
personal friends as far as it was consistent with our
respective positions, and, as soon as I received my first
appointment as an officer in the South Australian Military
Forces, he was one of the very first to welcome me to his
house.</p>
<p>It was just before Christmas, 1881, that General
Downes, the Commandant, sent for me to see him at his
office. I walked across the barrack square to the Military
Offices, and in a few minutes was shown into his room.
He informed me that he had been unable to arrange with
the Government to raise the nucleus of the Permanent
Artillery Force which was required to take charge of the
lately constructed Fort Glanville, and that, as a matter of
fact, the contractors had asked for an extension of the time
for its final handing over to the Government. He had,
however, pointed out the necessity for a duly qualified
Staff Instructor to be appointed to the Volunteer Force.
Several new units had been formed throughout the colony.
The localities in which the units had been raised were far
distant from the headquarters at Adelaide, and, unless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
the services of some such Staff Instructor were made available,
it could not be expected that they could be held
together. The Government had considered his recommendation
and had approved of it. He had, therefore,
recommended me for the position, pending the raising of
the artillery unit, and he had that morning been notified
that his recommendation had met with their approval.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have much pleasure,&#8221; he said, &#8220;in telling you this.
I have been watching your work, while you have been in
the police, and instructing them, with keen interest, and, I
am satisfied that you are quite capable of carrying out
the duties attached to your new appointment. I have seen
Mr. Peterswald, your Commissioner, and he is quite prepared
to grant you your discharge from the police. Please
arrange to see him, and tell him that I sent you, because
I would like you to start your new duties from the first of
the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have wondered, ever since that fateful interview with
the general, whether there is such a thing as second sight,
or&mdash;to put it another way, whether a person is permitted
at times to have a glimpse into the future. While the
general was talking to me, and as soon as he told me that
his recommendation had been approved of, and that the
appointment was actually made, I was looking at him
sitting in his chair at his office desk, and I thought that
I saw myself sitting in that very chair, actually in his
place, as Commandant of South Australia. The vision
was a passing one, but I well remember being seized with
a determination to do all I could to make that vision
come true. As will be seen later on, it did come true, and
in much shorter time than I or anybody else could have
possibly expected.</p>
<p>I at once, in accordance with the general&#8217;s wishes,
called on Mr. Peterswald. He was delighted at the good
news. He, of course, knew about it from the general.
He told me I could have leave of absence up to January 1,
the date on which I was to take up my work at the Military
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
Staff Office. My next business was to cable home to my
father to inform him of my appointment. I knew what a
pleasure it would be, most particularly to my mother, to
hear the news. From the time that I had left home my
only letters had been to my mother, and the only letters
I had received had been from her. She always kept me
fully informed of all the different doings of our large
Gordon family.</p>
<p>Yet it is wonderful to think what a difference it makes
to one&#8217;s ideas when you decide to place some 16,000 miles
between all your own best friends and your solitary self.
Your solitary self goes forth alone. You go into new
worlds, you leave behind all the pals of your youth, all
those whose friendship in after life would be an anchor to
you; all those sweet girls whom you love, all those relations
who always protested they were so ready and keen
to help you in your troubles, but who, when the time of
trouble comes, suddenly have so many troubles of their
own that they really can do nothing for you; but the
one whom you feel most to leave behind is your mother.</p>
<p>On the day following the news of my appointment I
called at Government House. My Woolwich mate,
Johnny Jervois, was more than delighted at the result of
his advice to me to remain in Adelaide. He and I had
some exciting times later on when the Russian scare
occurred in Australia in 1885; of which, more presently.
His Excellency the Governor, Sir William, gave me much
encouragement by the kind way in which he received me,
and I need hardly say that I felt somewhat overcome by
what appeared to me the extraordinary kindness of my
South Australian friends. With the exception of my
having been at Woolwich with young Jervois, all
were strangers to me on my arrival in Adelaide.
My resignation having been accepted I had ceased
to be a policeman, and I felt at full liberty to
accept any of the many invitations which were kindly
given to me for the forthcoming festive season. It was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
happy Christmas and New Year&#8217;s time. My Christmas
Day was spent with the general and his charming wife and
family, at their home at Mitcham, near Adelaide.</p>
<p>On New Year&#8217;s Eve and New Year&#8217;s Day respectively
I was the guest of the Governor and the new Commissioner,
Mr. Peterswald. I also obtained permission from
the Commissioner to invite my late police comrades to a
social evening at their barracks. That evening is one of
the happiest recollections of my life. During the months
I had been with them I had had no occasion, either as
their instructor or while in charge of the barracks, to find
any fault with their work. We had been brought closely
together, and, if at times a few hard words had to be
spoken as regards their duties, they fully recognized that
they were merited, and they bore no personal ill-will. The
South Australian Police were then, and have been since,
and are now, an efficient and fine body of men.</p>
<p>On January 1, 1882, I took up my duties at the Military
Staff Office. My mind was made up not to fail, but
to give effect to the vision I had, at the time of my interview
with the general, which had pointed to the Commandant&#8217;s
chair as my future lot.</p>
<p>How it was realized you will learn as you read on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>SOLDIERING IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA</h3>
</div>

<p>On January 2, 1882, I attended the staff office and began
my new duties. The general asked me to draw up a short
memorandum setting out how best to utilize my time
up to the end of the financial year&mdash;June 30. My special
work was the instruction of the Volunteer Companies and
detachments stationed in the country, as apart from the
units maintained within the metropolitan area of Adelaide.
It is worth while for you to study the map of South
Australia. In order to carry out these duties very large
tracts of country had to be covered by rail and road.</p>
<p>The amount of money placed on the estimates to cover
travelling expenses was by no means large, so it was very
necessary to work out an itinerary for the half-year, which,
while enabling the units to get as much instruction as
possible, would not entail any expenditure beyond that
placed at my disposal. In addition to this, I was in
charge of the office work in connexion with the whole
of the Volunteer branch of the military forces at that time
serving in South Australia. With the assistance of a
smart clerk placed at my disposal by the general I was
well able to fulfil these duties to his satisfaction. By
the end of the week the itinerary submitted by me received
approval and a fair start was made.</p>
<p>The Colony of South Australia was founded upon lines
that differed from those on which the rest of the Australian
Colonies started their existence. The Chartered Company
of South Australia was entrusted by the British Government
with the development of an immense tract of country
stretching right up through the centre of Australia from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
the south to the north coast. The Northern Territory came
under its administration. This tract of country approached
in size nearly to one-third of the whole of Australia. South
Australia has been called the &#8220;Cinderella&#8221; of the Australian
Colonies, not only because she was the youngest,
but also because of the character of her constitution. The
original settlers had landed on virgin soil, untainted by
previous settlements of convict prisoners. South Australia
had not begun as a Crown Colony. The Chartered Company
had been granted self government from the day
that the ships conveying the original settlers cast their
anchors off the shores of Glenelg, and they held their first
official meeting under the spreading branches of the gum
tree whose bent old trunk still marks that historic spot. It
was on December 28, 1836, that the landing took place.
Every year since that date the anniversary of that
auspicious day has been set aside for a national holiday.
The now exceedingly prosperous seaside resort of Glenelg
hums each December 28 with joyous holiday makers. A
banquet, presided over by the mayor, and attended by
the Governor, the Premier, members of the Government
and Parliament, is held to commemorate the birthday of
the Colony and do honour to the few surviving veteran
colonists who took part in the ceremony of the proclamation
under the shade of the historic gum tree in 1836.</p>
<p>I have just looked up last year&#8217;s Press account of
this ceremony, and I find the following names mentioned,
there are only two dating from 1836&mdash;Miss Marianne
Fisher and Mrs. M. A. Boneham, who were on that date
still alive.</p>
<p>The capital of South Australia is Adelaide. I have
travelled over many parts of the world, and venture to
say I have seen every important city and town in
Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. I have no
hesitation in proclaiming Adelaide the best as regards
situation, laying out, and climate. The genuine hospitality
of its citizens is well known. Its site was most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
carefully selected and surveyed, and the city itself laid
out and planned by a very able Engineer officer, Colonel
Light. There was no hurry, no fuss, when this was
done. Colonel Light was given an absolute free hand,
besides ample time in which to complete his work. No
better monument exists to his memory than the city of
Adelaide itself. Colonel Light gave full consideration to
the chief requirements of a city. He appears to have
selected from different parts of the world the best characteristics
of their cities and to have embodied them in
his conception and plan of Adelaide. Nothing which
could be of benefit in days to come seems to have been
overlooked. The most important item, perhaps&mdash;namely,
facility for a perfect system of drainage&mdash;had been evidently
kept in view when the site was chosen. In after
years, when it was deemed advisable to instal what is known
as the deep drainage system, the best known up to date,
it was found that it could be carried out without the
slightest difficulty, not only throughout the city proper,
but also in the numerous suburbs, which are steadily
growing in population outside the beautiful park lands
surrounding it. Practically Adelaide proper covers one
square mile of ground, East Terrace being the only broken
side. Around this square mile lies a belt of park lands
averaging about a quarter of a mile wide. The suburbs
commence beyond these park lands, the oldest and chief
one, North Adelaide, being itself surrounded by a similar
belt.</p>
<p>The park lands are indeed the lungs of the city. It
is forbidden to erect any private buildings thereon. No
portions of them may be alienated except for general
purposes, such as public institutions, gardens, exhibitions,
racecourses, cricket and football ovals. The rights of the
citizens to their park lands are guarded by impenetrable
legal safeguards. Adelaide has been at times called the
&#8220;city of the five squares,&#8221; also the &#8220;city of the twin
towers,&#8221; namely, those of the post office and Town Hall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
In the middle of the centre square marking the heart of
the city stands the statue of Queen Victoria. What city
do you know whose citizens can, after a day of heat,
within a few minutes&#8217; walk from their homes be enjoying
the advantages of being in the country by visiting the park
lands? I know none other.</p>
<p>Adelaide nestles at the foot of a beautiful range of
hills, the highest point of which, &#8220;Mount Lofty,&#8221; some
2,000 feet high, rises overlooking the city. Numbers of
spurs slope gracefully towards the plain, whose shores
the sea washes&mdash;the sea whence the cool breezes blow
over the city. What a glorious sight can be seen from
Mount Lofty on a full moonlight night! Stand on Mount
Lofty, look up and revel in the sight of an Australian
summer night&#8217;s sky, the dark but ethereally clear bluish
dome overhead, myriads of little stars, blinking at the
steady brilliant light of the greater constellations. Look
right and left&mdash;on all sides the spurs, covered with misty
haze, lose themselves as they merge into the plains. Look
west towards the city and the sea. There beneath the
soft and silvery rays of the moon lies Adelaide and its
suburbs, wrapt in the peace and quiet of the night. Its
thousands of street lights shine so clear that they seem
to lie at your feet. You see deep, dark places amongst
the lights; there are the park lands. Then raise your
eyes and look farther west; there is the sea. It shines
as a silver mirror. The soft winds from the west are
blowing, and the wavelets, dancing in the light of the
moon, play with her shining rays as they leap on to
break gently on the sandy beach. Many times have I
revelled in this sight while staying with my friend, John
Bakewell, whose beautiful home is close to the top of
the mount.</p>
<p>Colonel Light must have also kept in mind the
climatic conditions. From any part of the city a drive
of less than a couple of hours will take one up some
fifteen to eighteen hundred feet above the sea. The railways,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
and afterwards the advent of the motor-cars, have
brought the hills down to Adelaide and the plain, and
the many and beautiful homes now adorning the crests
of the ridges and nestled there might almost be suburbs.
See the lovely foliage of the trees, gathered from all parts
of the world. Look at the gardens, luxuriant in blooms,
where the flowers revel in rivalling each other in beauty
and colour and in profusion of blossoms. See the ripening
fruits festooning the trees in the orchards.</p>
<p>It is amongst such surroundings that the fortunate
citizens of Adelaide live, and there it was my privilege
to spend&mdash;I say so without the slightest reservation&mdash;the
happiest years of my life. Would they could come again.</p>
<p>You are not surprised now, are you, that the citizens
of Adelaide fully recognize the debt of gratitude they
owe Colonel Light? His memory they cherish. His name
will ever be an honoured one. His monument, Adelaide
itself, a living one which will last until the day when the
last trumpet shall sound &#8220;the assembly.&#8221; His recompense,
the gratitude of her citizens right up to that day.</p>
<p>The development of the defence system of the colony
of South Australia was as follows: In its early days the
British Government maintained a small garrison of regular
soldiers, with their headquarters in Adelaide. This
garrison was at the disposal of the local Government;
the Governor was Commander-in-Chief. It was not
anticipated then that troops from Australia would be
required to do battle for the Empire in European wars.
There was little trouble to fear from the aboriginal
tribes. History repeated itself in the case of South
Australia. As it had happened in the older colonies, the
aborigines did not give cause for the slightest anxiety,
except on a few occasions when intrepid and daring explorers
went forth into the wild bush country miles and
miles away from any habitation. Barracks were built
for the regular garrison. On the date I started my duties
the building was being utilized as an institution for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
poor and infirm. The military staff office and the mounted
police barracks were adjacent to it.</p>
<p>So long as the garrison of regulars remained at
Adelaide there was no particular inducement for the
pioneers to burden themselves with the additional responsibilities
of becoming soldiers themselves. Yet have you
ever known or heard of any British settlement, no matter
how small, which did not elect a mayor and raise a
volunteer force? When the time came for the British
Government to remove the regular garrison, the South
Australian volunteer force was established. This took
place on the conclusion of the Maori War, which was
followed by the peaceful settlement of the native question
in the north island of New Zealand. The British Government
decided to withdraw all regular troops from New
Zealand and Australia then, feeling assured that the
colonists, who had already given the best and strongest
evidence and proof of their capacity to direct the affairs
and develop the resources of the immense territories entrusted
into their hands, were more than capable of raising
and organizing military units on lines best adapted to
their own economic and political requirements. Thus it
was that at the time the regulars were withdrawn fairly
efficient volunteer forces had come into existence.</p>
<p>The South Australian Government retained the services
of some of the regular non-commissioned officers as instructors,
and of some of the officers for staff duties. At the time
I joined the staff some of these were still going healthy
and strong. Well I remember Major Williams, our staff
quartermaster, Captain Powell, our cavalry instructor,
Sergeant-Majors Ryan and Connell, infantry instructors,
two of the best. They were with me then, they were
under me for years; they never wavered in their zeal,
nor had I once, in our long association together, ever
to find fault with them or their work, not even in later
days, when the holders of the public purse set the pruning
knives clicking and the military vote suffered so severely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
as to necessitate much extra work on the part of those
who remained on the staff.</p>
<p>The growth of the colony steadily continued, never
halting, though occasionally bad seasons checked its
progress. In the &#8217;seventies South Australia was fully
established. Adelaide was becoming a rich and populous
city, the capital of a great territory. A stupendous pioneer
work, the overland telegraph right through the continent
from Adelaide in the south to Port Darwin in the north,
had been completed, some 2,000 miles through unoccupied
country. The Burra-Burra copper mines had given forth
their store of the copper. The Moonta and Wallaroo
district was still richer in that precious metal. Even now
there appears to be no end to the wealth of metal lying
below the ground waiting for the pick of the miner.
Millions of acres of wild bush land had been turned into
rolling grass plains on which millions of sheep browsed
in peace. In the settled districts along the Northern Railway
line to Port Augusta paddocks after paddocks of
smiling and rustling wheatfields waited for the harvesting
machines each autumn time.</p>
<p>The question of the advisability of establishing the
Defence Force of the colony on a sounder footing was
taken up by the Government, which came to the decision
that it would be in the best interests of the forces to appoint
a regular Imperial officer, thoroughly efficient and up to
date, who should be entrusted with the reorganization,
administration and instruction of the Defence Department
and the forces under its control. This decision met with
all-round approval. Politicians, Press, members of the
then existing forces and the public generally all concurred.
A request was sent to the Imperial Government, asking
for the services on loan for five years of an officer possessing
the qualifications referred to. The selection fell on
Lieut.-Colonel (now Major-General) M. F. Downes, R.A.,
C.M.G., who is still alive and well in Melbourne, and whose
constant friendship I have had the privilege of enjoying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
from the date I first took up my duties under him. He lost
no time on his arrival in carrying out his instructions, and
submitted a scheme for the Government&#8217;s approval. The
general lines of his scheme were as follows: The military
forces were to consist of (<i>a</i>) an efficient administrative and
instructional staff; (<i>b</i>) a number of regular (permanent)
artillery units to man the forts and maintain them in a
state of thorough efficiency; (<i>c</i>) a force comprising all
branches of the service, inclusive of departmental and
non-combatant corps on a partially paid system; (<i>d</i>) the
maintenance of a volunteer force to meet the requirements
of outlying districts; and (<i>e</i>) the encouragement of rifle
clubs.</p>
<p>The only part of this scheme which requires some little
explanation is the partially paid force, the backbone of
the scheme. General Downes proposed that instead of
the three months&#8217; continuous training carried out by the
Militia at home, the partially paid units should be paid
by the day, the maximum number of days being fixed
by Act of Parliament. Eight hours a day or over constituted
a full day for purposes of pay; up to four hours,
half a day; and two hours or less, a quarter day. A proviso
existed that a few days of continuous training in
camp should take place each year. The original number
of full days in the year first approved of was, I think,
twenty-four, and the rate of pay 5s. a day. Whole holidays,
of which there are a good many in the colonies,
were available for full day, half-holidays and Saturday
afternoons for half-day, and all evenings for quarter-day
parades. By the time I joined the general&#8217;s staff his
system had been in force for over three years, was giving
satisfaction to all concerned, and similar conditions of
service were later on adopted in every one of the Australian
colonies.</p>
<p>The itinerary for the half-year ending June 30, 1882,
which General Downes had approved of, kept me
continually on the move. The days in between my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
journeys in the country were fully occupied with the
compilation of reports and other administrative duties.
It was all a new experience to me. I travelled hundreds
of miles. The residents in the outlying districts offered
me every hospitality. Horses, of course, were always
available. Kangaroo and wallaby hunts, shooting and
fishing parties, were arranged to fill up the time in spare
days. The wild turkey is indeed a wary bird; he wants
a lot of stalking, especially in the open salt bush plains.
An ox or cow was often made use of to approach this
knowing bird. It was considered an excellent day&#8217;s sport
if we bagged a brace or two.</p>
<p>Six months sped by. Then came the day when the
general informed me that the Government had approved
of the raising of the Regular (Permanent) Artillery unit.
Fort Glanville had been completed, the guns mounted,
and the contractors had handed over the fort to the
Government. I remember the general&#8217;s kind words to
me so well. He told me he was pleased with my work,
that he had reported upon my success as staff instructor
to the volunteer force, that he had recommended me for
the position of Lieutenant Commanding the Permanent
Artillery unit, and that the Government had approved.</p>
<p>So at last I had got appointed to my own branch of the
service&mdash;once again I was a gunner. I took up my residence
at the fort, where there was barrack accommodation
for about thirty men and quarters for one officer. Within
three weeks I had got together a first-class lot of young
men, and the general came down to inspect us. An
efficient gunner is not made in a day, no, nor even in a
year, so that for months I had little time for play. In
addition a most interesting and difficult piece of work
came my way. The fixed defences, recommended by Sir
William Jervois and General Scratchley, consisted of
three forts, one not far from the mouth of the Port River,
a second one approximately half-way between the mouth
of the river and Glenelg, and the third one near Glenelg.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
At that time there were not sufficient funds to undertake
the completion of the whole scheme. The centre one,
Fort Glanville, was considered the most important, and
had therefore been constructed first. The plans for the
other forts had been prepared at the same time as those
for Fort Glanville.</p>
<p>The coast from Glenelg to the mouth of the Port
River is very low, a continuous ridge of sandy dunes
fringing a beautiful sea beach from which the waters recede
far at low tide. The mail boats anchored in the open
roadstead; passengers landed at the Semaphore jetty,
cargo being placed in barges and towed up the river
to Port Adelaide. It was a most unsatisfactory arrangement,
and many have been the times that I got wet
through when meeting the steamers. In particularly rough
weather baskets had to be used to get on or off the ship.
When it was too rough and dangerous passengers had
to be taken on to the next port of call. For years the
question of providing proper harbour accommodation had
been before successive Governments, but the vested
interests at Port Adelaide and other political reasons
had successfully blocked the project. About the beginning
of 1882, however, a company was formed, which
acquired a large frontage to the sea from the boundaries
of the Semaphore northwards to the mouth of the Port
River. This company obtained the right to construct a
harbour. It was called the Largs Bay Company. It built
a first-class up-to-date hotel on the foreshore, constructed
a fine jetty, and a railway leading into Port Adelaide,
with the view of diverting the landing of the passengers
from the old Semaphore Government jetty to Largs Bay.
All this will probably be of little interest to you, except
that it supplies a reason for the influences that were
brought to bear on the Government to construct No. 2
Fort. If the outer harbour was to be constructed, its
protection was necessary. Hence I was instructed by the
general to revise the original plans of the Fort and adapt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
them to the new fortress guns, which had superseded
those existing at the time of the construction of Fort
Glanville. To plan forts, to obtain the widest scope for
the fire power of their guns, is fascinating work to a
gunner. I revelled in it, and in a few weeks I was ready
with the revised plans. The plans were approved of, and
the contract was let for its construction. Largs Bay Hotel
then became my headquarters.</p>
<p>The time came when the building of the Largs Fort
was advanced enough to push on with the mounting of
the heavy guns, which on arrival had been stored at Port
Adelaide, some three miles away. The hauling of the
guns and carriages and their assembling and mounting
was excellent instruction to my young gunners. In revising
the plans of the Fort I had made provision for
barrack accommodation for a larger body of men.</p>
<p>Fort Glanville has now for some time past been dismantled.
The proposed fort near Glenelg was never built,
though two 9.2 inch B.L. guns, which were imported at
great cost as the result of the Russian scare, are still
lying buried in the sand hills on the proposed site.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>POLO, HUNTING AND STEEPLECHASING</h3>
</div>

<p>While busy with my professional duties I found time
to amuse myself as well. My friends at the club had put
my name up as a member. I was soon elected. You
will doubtless smile when I tell you what happened the
first time I entered the club as a full member. It had
been a very hot day. A visiting team of polo players
from the western district of Victoria had battled hard
in the afternoon against the Adelaide team. The good
game of polo in those days was in its infancy in Australia.
A few enthusiasts in Adelaide and some in the wonderfully
rich western district of Victoria, the De Littles, Manifolds,
Blacks and others who owned thousands of acres of
as good country as there is in Australia, kept the game
going. An inter-colonial match was arranged. Lance
Stirling, now Sir Lancelot, and President of the Upper
House, Arthur Malcolm, a thorough sportsman with a
keen love for practical jokes, and the two brothers Edmund
and Charlie Bowman, were playing for Adelaide. The
old veteran, Dave Palmer, St. Quintin, Para Hood and
one of the Manifolds represented the western district of
Victoria.</p>
<p>It was the custom to celebrate all such occasions as
polo matches, big race days, Hunt Club meetings, by
holding dinner parties at the club, often attended by fifty
or sixty of the younger members, with a sprinkling of the
older sports, who thoroughly enjoyed the vivacity and
exuberance of the younger men. These were dinners to
be remembered, full of joyous spirits, where many amusing
incidents used to occur. As the hours of the evening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
grew late and the early morning approached the fun was
at its height. I happened to choose this very particular
night for my first visit to the club after my election as a
full member. I knew what was going on, and, though I
thought it better to avoid going there that night, an irresistible
feeling came over me and I succumbed to it. So,
at about eleven o&#8217;clock I made my appearance. It had
been a long time, in fact, not since I had left Melbourne,
that I had had a real jolly night. I had held the bit
particularly tight between my teeth during my time in the
police, and I did feel inclined for a jollification. I got
it all right. I was greeted all round with the heartiest
welcome. Congratulations on my appointment were
showered on me, and in a few minutes I was as recklessly
enjoying the fun as they were. While the large dining-room
was being prepared for an obstacle race cock-fighting
held sway. An amateur orchestra with improvised instruments,
coal-scuttles, pots and pans, hair-combs and other
similar objects was playing in the back court of the club,
in the centre of which there was a fountain. Some enterprising
member had offered a prize to anyone who hopped
twice round the narrow parapet, surrounding its basin,
without falling in, while keeping time to the music. It
certainly was difficult to follow the strains of that band.
From a very slow and dignified movement the music
suddenly broke into the quickest time that ever any tune
was played. The result was fatal to the hopper. A bath in
the fountain followed. The prize was not won that night.
And so the frolic ran on till the early hours of the morning.</p>
<p>I felt somewhat sorry for myself when I turned up next
day at the office. I didn&#8217;t feel much inclined for work,
and I waited patiently for noon to strike to make my way
to the club and a large whisky and soda. Lunch-time
approached. I began to notice that several of the older
members were looking serious and were not so affable as
usual. The secretary asked me to step into his office.
I did so. He, too, was looking serious. He told me that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
it had been reported to him that I had on my very first
visit, as a member of the club upset the whole place, that
my good old friend Mr Hamilton, who lived at the club,
had complained bitterly of the noise and disturbance, and
was going to ask the committee to cancel my election
and practically have me turned out. He himself had been
forced to call a special meeting of the committee to deal
with the matter. I sat, quiet and sad, by the side of the
old fountain. Every now and again one of the chief
offenders of the night before would, as he passed me,
sympathize with me in my trouble. My misery did not
last long. Two or three members of the committee entered
the secretary&#8217;s office. Presently the secretary beckoned
me to his office. Round a table sat three members of the
committee. In the centre of the small table was a magnum
of champagne and a small bucket of ice. In silence the
glasses were filled up. The oldest member of the committee,
still as serious as a judge, handed me one. They
each helped themselves. Then he spoke: &#8220;We have
asked you to come here this morning&#8221;&mdash;and then a smile
came over their faces&mdash;&#8220;to welcome you to the club and
to say how happy we are that you have got your appointment.&#8221;
Thus ended my anxiety, and a few minutes later
on the magnum of champagne. I had certainly had my
leg pulled.</p>
<p>In view of my duties in connexion with the construction
of the new fort I moved to the Largs Bay Hotel.
Standing by itself mid-way between the two forts at the
shore end of the jetty, the hotel had been completed and
opened with much rejoicing. Mr. Hixon was its first
manager. No expense had been spared by the company
in making it not only comfortable, but luxurious. The
winter months were just beginning; there was no attraction
to the seaside, and there were but few residents. The
monotony of living there was varied two days each week
by the arrival of the inward and outward bound mail
steamers, that was all. But I was too busy to worry about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
pleasure; the training of my men at Fort Glanville and
the supervision of the construction of Fort Largs kept me
busy five days of the week. Saturday and Sunday I
devoted to sport and pleasure. The polo season ended
with the autumn; hunting began with early winter.</p>
<p>Had anyone told me in the days when I used to be
carried into the boats on the good old ship <i>Waipa</i> that
within a couple of years I would once again be enjoying
playing polo, following the hounds and steeplechasing, I
would not have believed them. Yet so it was. The hunting
season coming on, I at once set to work to get a
couple of good mounts. Good Mother Luck was, as usual,
again on my side. A friend of mine, Leonard Browne,
who owned Buckland Park Station, about twenty-five miles
from Adelaide, offered me one of his station horses. We
named him Buckland. He was the soundest and best
jumper I ever threw my legs across. He was even better
than &#8220;Kate Dwyer.&#8221; For two seasons he never gave me
a fall. I have, for a wager, put up a sheet of corrugated
iron six feet long by two and a half feet wide, leaning it
slanting against a rest, in the middle of a paddock, and,
jumping on Buckland&#8217;s back, I would ride him straight
at it. He never bothered to go to the right or left of it.
The old horse would take it in his stride and sail over it
without rapping it. Wire fences were child&#8217;s play to him;
he got over them just as easily as he negotiated post and
rails.</p>
<p>Satan, a thoroughbred I bought after a selling race at
Morphetville, was my second string. He had broken
down in his near foreleg during the race. He was only
three years old, jet black, sixteen hands one, and as handsome
as paint. I had named him Satan. I had by this
time been asked by the general on several occasions to
accompany him as his staff officer at such times as he
was making his inspections, and I thought it would be
well for me to have a decent charger. The general liked
a good horse. Satan was just the horse. I had him for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
some twelve years. I schooled him to jump, and he took
to it very kindly. Many are the miles of road travelling
he saved me when later on we were busy with field
man&oelig;uvres, by his jumping capacities. Satan was not
a &#8220;Buckland,&#8221; but he seldom failed me. So it came to
pass that I was able to enjoy many a good day with the
hounds on Saturday afternoons; then a good dinner, the
theatre, and afterwards a little fun and light-hearted supper
and frolic at the club till the early hours of Sunday
morning.</p>
<p>What a crowd of real good sportsmen lived in Adelaide
in those days! Perhaps the oldest and most respected of
the professional sports was Mr. Filgate. Then there was
Seth Ferry, who had ridden many a hard race in his life;
Saville, as clever with his pencil as he was as a trainer&mdash;brother-in-law,
I think, of Leslie Macdonald, who afterwards
managed Wilson&#8217;s stud at St. Albans, Victoria,
and on Wilson&#8217;s death became an owner himself, and a
successful one, too. Revenue won the Melbourne Cup for
him, and several other good horses have in late years
carried his colours to the front in first-class races. Leslie
Macdonald is still a very well-preserved man, a first-class
sport, and a good companion. Tom Power was another
good trainer, and Johnny Hill, who trained Auraria, the
Melbourne Cup winner. The pride of place amongst
breeders was then taken by Sir Thomas Elder. The stud
farm at Morphetville left nothing to be desired. The renowned
chestnut, Gang Forward, and a big-boned bay
horse named Neckesgat were the lords of the harem.
Some twenty brood mares, descendants of the best strains
of thoroughbred stock, had been brought together, and
many a good horse which played about as a foal at Morphetville&#8217;s
beautiful paddocks afterwards won classical
races.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Elder was at this time fairly on the wrong
side of fifty. He was a bachelor. He and his brother-in-law,
Mr. Barr Smith, were the heads of that well-known
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
firm, Elder, Smith and Co., which was interested in many
important concerns, and, <i>inter alia</i>, represented the P. &amp;
O. S. N. Co., mail contractors to Australia. This company&#8217;s
ships called in at Adelaide once a week, the
incoming and outgoing mail in turn. Sir Thomas usually
invited the captain to his house during the steamer&#8217;s stay
in the roadstead.</p>
<p>They used to tell of him that though he took the greatest
pleasure in the Morphetville stud, he knew but little about
horses. Sir Thomas delighted in taking his guests through
the paddocks, his manager close beside him. &#8220;Now
there,&#8221; Sir Thomas would say, &#8220;isn&#8217;t that a fine horse?
Now, Mr. Ellworthy, just tell us all about him.&#8221; It was
generally a her. But when he came to White Arab
stallion Mr. Ellworthy&#8217;s services were not required. Sir
Thomas&#8217;s partner, Mr. Robert Barr Smith, might well
be named the Grand Old Man of South Australia. He
died at a very ripe old age&mdash;a charming personality, a
shrewd man of business, a most generous citizen whose
gifts were munificent, and equalled only by those of his
brother-in-law, Sir Thomas. Mr. Barr Smith&#8217;s principal
home, Torrens Park, some six miles from Adelaide,
situated at the foot of the hills, was always open house to
his friends. I can never forget the many happy days I
spent there, and who, of the many who were privileged to
be their friends, can ever forget the charming personality,
the sweet ways, and the generous nature of Mrs. Barr
Smith?</p>
<p>My pen runs away with me when I think of all my kind
friends in those happy days. But let me not forget one
family, the Bakers of Morialta. The Hon. John Baker
was one of the first citizens of Adelaide to appreciate the
value of the Mount Lofty ranges as a home during the
summer months. He took up some hundreds of acres in
what was at that time bush country up the heights to the
north of Mount Lofty. I do not know whether Norton&#8217;s
Summit, in the neighbourhood of which he purchased the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
land, was so named when he built his comfortable home
at Morialta. The entrance gates into that beautiful domain
are just past the village which bears the name Norton&#8217;s
Summit. The Hon. John Baker was a politician, but he was
also a sportsman and a horse breeder. I think I am right
in stating that he bred that good horse Don Juan, which
started the &#8220;King&#8221; of Australian bookmakers, Joe
Thompson, in his triumphant career. Not to know Joe
Thompson in those days in Australia meant not to know
Australia. He was the leviathan of the turf, or at least,
he became so, and a keen sportsman he was, too. Of all
sports horse racing has always the pride of place in
Australia, though others flourish there.</p>
<p>To Mrs. John Baker, Mr. Baker&#8217;s widow, I owe a deep
debt of gratitude. From the time I first arrived in Adelaide
she made me welcome at Morialta. Her eldest son,
who later on became Sir Richard Baker, President of the
Legislative Council of South Australia, was a good sport
and a true friend of mine up to the time of his death.</p>
<p>I believe that it was his father who established the first
pack of hounds in South Australia. The kennels were at
Morialta. At the time I am writing of, Allen Baker, a
younger brother of Sir Richard, was Master. I was his
best man on his marriage day. I remember it so well,
though it was so long ago. He was quite nervous about
the whole thing, as he called it, the evening before. I
tried to cheer him up. He told me that he particularly
wished the clergyman to cut the service as short as possible,
and I was on no account to let him &#8220;make a speech.&#8221;
I duly warned the clergyman in the morning, and he took
the hint. I fortified Allen with a small bottle of champagne
just before the ceremony, which took place at the
church at Mitcham. He just got through it, and, as soon
as he got out of the church, he jumped up into the four-wheeled
dogcart that was waiting for him and, taking hold
of the reins, with his pretty bride beside him, drove away
as happy as a bird. His nervousness had disappeared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>Perhaps the most enjoyable event of the year in Adelaide
was the occasion when the Hunt Club Races took
place. The meeting was held at the close of the season,
and a right merry meeting it was too. It was a huge
picnic, winding up with dinner and theatre parties, dances,
and good old suppers. I had nothing good enough to
win any race. Buckland was a sure jumper, but not fast
enough. Satan&#8217;s foreleg would not stand training. However,
one never knows one&#8217;s luck in steeplechasing, so I
sent Buckland to Leslie Macdonald to be trained, and
promised myself a real ding-dong jumping day over the
big sticks at Morphetville&mdash;and I had it, too. The two
principal races were the Drag Cup and the Hunt Club
Cup&mdash;the former about two miles and three-quarters, the
latter about four miles. A maiden steeple, a hurdle race
and a hunters&#8217; flat race filling up the programme. The
best horse at the meeting that year was named Albatross,
a jet black, curiously enough, and the property of a good
sport, Mick Morris, a Government stock inspector. Albatross
had been heavily backed to win the double, the Drag
and Hunt Club Cups. I think it was Bob Turner who rode
him in the Hunt Club Cup. He had bad luck opposite the
grand stand, for he struck the wall hard the second time
round and unseated Bob. The race was over as far as
Albatross was concerned, and so were the double wagers
as far as Mick Morris and his friends were concerned.
But Mick and his pals meant to get their money again by
backing Albatross straight out for the Drag Cup. Bob
Turner had been badly shaken by his fall, and was unable
to ride again. Morris asked me to ride him. I had
already ridden old Buckland in the Maiden Steeple and
Hunt Club Cups some six miles, without being near
winning, so I thought I would oblige Morris.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Albatross being top-weight had a heavy
impost to carry, some 13 st. 4 lb. I rode only about
11 st. 6 lb. in those days, so I had to put up some two
stones dead weight. The saddle was a heavy, old-fashioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
hunting one, and taking it for granted all was
well I jumped on Albatross&#8217;s back in the saddling paddock
and jogged quietly down to the starting point.
There were some eight starters. Down went the flag,
away we went, and I took Albatross to the front. He was
a fine jumper, but he had one fault; he was inclined to
run down his fences, and squirm a little when jumping.
We went once round the course. We were coming to the
wall for the second time just in front of the grand stand
and Albatross was moving like a bird. I let him just
&#8220;gang his ain gait&#8221;; nothing behind me could force the
pace. He led the field easily, and I felt more than confident
that the race was mine. But you never can tell.
He came to the wall. He had to shorten his stride in
taking it, which made him squirm more than usual. I
felt something go; it was my left stirrup leather. The
clip holding it to the saddle had been left open, and the
wrench of my left leg as Albatross jumped had pulled the
leather out. I managed to keep the stirrup iron hanging
on to my foot with the end of the leather trailing on the
ground as we galloped on. I had hopes I might recover
the leather, and by holding on to it with my left hand
make some use of it. It was not to be. In my efforts
to pick up the leather I had to slow Albatross down. This
enabled the other horses to close up to me. There was
only one thing to do&mdash;let the stirrup go and set Albatross
sailing again. This I did. At the next fence&mdash;a stiff log
one&mdash;I was nearly jerked clean off. I had forgotten I was
riding with only one stirrup, and, as Albatross swerved
in jumping, I all but fell off on the near side. It struck
me that if I did not get rid of the other stirrup I would
probably be thrown soon, so I got rid of it. I now found
myself with about a mile and a half to go, some ten real
stiff fences to negotiate, and riding without stirrups. I
quite well remember my memory harking back for a
moment to the old days of the riding school at Woolwich
when old Dan, our riding master, used to call out, &#8220;Cross
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
stirrups,&#8221; and &#8220;Take care&#8221; and &#8220;&#8217;Old on.&#8221; Well, it
was a case of &#8220;&#8217;olding on&#8221; on Albatross for the rest of
that journey. It was soon over. Albatross sailed along. I
couldn&#8217;t hold him, but kept in on the course. Young Farr
on Peter came after me. We raced together at the last
fence. Over we went; both landed safely, but I was beat.
Farr, sitting comfortably on Peter, led me past the post.
The only consolation I had was that I had not been responsible
for saddling Albatross. My good old friend
Michael Morris, though he had lost his money, thought I
had put up a real good fight, and gave me a present of a
handsome hunting-crop to remind me of my ride on that
good horse Albatross. We had a glorious winding up to
that day. The Hunt dinner at the club, a large theatre
party, and a dance. Indeed, I was glad when I got to bed
at the end of it all.</p>
<p>On the close of the hunting season followed the polo
season. It was arduous work to play polo in the heat of
the summer, but it could not be helped. The first polo
ground was in the park lands inside the Victoria race-course.
Now the Polo Club owns a clubhouse and a tip-top
ground not far from the city. Ponies were rather
difficult to get in those days, and when you did get them
there was very little opportunity to train them. It was
with difficulty we managed to get one practice game a
week with full sides. Several of the members of the Polo
Club lived in the country, and it was difficult for them
to spare the time to come into town for a game; besides,
it was a fairly expensive game. Still, we battled away
against all difficulties, and the game of polo was kept going
in South Australia while the richer and older colonies of
New South Wales and Victoria practically dropped it.</p>
<p>Of recent years polo has become a favourite pastime
throughout Australia, especially in many country districts,
and after the War will doubtless become one of its national
games. At the close of the hunting season I had turned
out Buckland and Satan for a long spell, and picked up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
four or five ponies. I got some stables put up at Fort
Glanville. The splendid beach at low tide afforded an
excellent practice ground. The season moved along all
well; we had only one severe accident. The game in those
days began by placing the ball on the ground half-way
between the goals. A player from each side was selected
to gallop at a given signal from the goal posts to the ball.
On the particular afternoon of the accident the two players
selected were Tom Barr Smith and George Hawker. By
some accident the two rode straight at each other; the
ponies met head to head. There was quite a loud report.
It was the cracking of the skull of one of the ponies. The
pony had to be shot, but no particular harm was done to
the riders. As a result of this accident it was decided to
alter the rules of the game. This was done, and there was
no more wild galloping to start the game. After trying
several ponies, I was successful in getting hold of two
real good ones. One was a light, cream-coloured mare,
descended from a Welsh Taffy imported sire. I called
her &#8220;Creamie.&#8221; She was a flyer. The other, a well-bred
little bay, which I named &#8220;Kitty,&#8221; I bought from the
Governor&#8217;s A.D.C., Captain Williams.</p>
<p>The polo season closed with a race meeting, just as
the hunting season did. The chief event was the Polo
Club Cup. I felt fairly confident that I had that year&#8217;s
cup in my pocket. For some six weeks before the races
I had sent Creamie and Kitty to Mr. Ellworthy at Morphetville,
who had kindly undertaken to supervise their
training. As the result of trials Creamie proved much the
faster. Not only that, but she started breaking watch-records.
The day of the races came. I had promised
Allen Baker, the Master of the Hounds, to have the mount
on Creamie. A real good sportsman, Stephen Ralli, was
to ride Kitty. I was too heavy myself to tackle the
weights. Creamie was made favourite at even money.
Kitty started at 20 to 1. Off they went to the post. I
think Lance Stirling was starter. There were about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
eighteen starters. Creamie was next but two to the rails.
I had backed her for quite a lot of money, and had told
all my friends that I could not see what other pony could
beat her. They all put their money on. I had not a
sixpence on Kitty. Well, down went the flag. I was in
the grand stand with my glasses fixed on the starting
point. The first thing I saw was one of the riders turning
a somersault in the air. It was Allen Baker. I of
course at once lost all interest in the race. I put down my
glasses. Down the course came Creamie leading the field
riderless. Then I heard the shouting: &#8220;Kitty! Kitty
wins!&#8221; and before I realized it, she had won. Yes,
Stephen Ralli had won the cup on Kitty for me. I had
lost £300.</p>
<p>My recollections of the introduction of cash betting,
as opposed to the system of booking bets &#8220;on the nod&#8221;
in the betting ring on Australian race-courses, are as follows:
Not long after my first appointment in Adelaide
the annual big racing meeting was held by the Adelaide
Racing Club at their course in the park lands, east of the
city. Large numbers of the best-known bookmakers from
the other colonies were as usual in attendance. Their
voices were hardly what could be called musical. As a
rule each one gave his own voice some peculiar note, so
that their would-be clients could spot their whereabouts in
the ring. The result of this chorus was unique as a musical
phenomenon.</p>
<p>I think it was the Cup Day. It was fine overhead and
hot, yet a charming day. The race for the Cup was next,
and the ring was settling down to business. Suddenly,
amidst the general uproar, a fine-sounding voice, true and
melodious, was heard intoning what at first sounded to
most people a church hymn. But it was not a church
hymn. It was a new method of shouting out the odds,
attracting attention to an exceedingly well-got-up gentleman
in a grey frock suit, patent leather boots, white spats,
grey gloves, tall white hat, and a flower in his buttonhole.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
A new bookmaker had made his appearance. He informed
the crowds in song that he betted &#8220;only for cash,&#8221; not
&#8220;on the nod&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;I pay on the winner, immediately after
the race.&#8221; It only wanted an organ to accompany him.
It was quite amusing to watch the remainder of his
brethren in the ring. At first they looked about for the
songster; then they laughed; and then set to work
fairly to howl him down. It was no use; he managed
somehow to make his dulcet notes heard. The new arrival
before the end of the day was well known. His experiment
had succeeded; it had been a first-class advertisement,
and he gathered in many clients.</p>
<p>He left Adelaide for the sister States. Some time afterwards
an amusing story went the round of sporting
circles. Whether true or not I know not. Here it is.
The committee of one of the most important bookmakers&#8217;
clubs in Australia had occasion to adjudicate on a charge
laid against him for conduct which it was stated rendered
him an undesirable member of the club, to the honorary
membership of which he had been admitted. The committee,
after inquiry, decided to request him to see them,
inform him of the charge that had been made against him,
ask him if he wished to refute it; if not, it was their intention
to cancel his membership. His answer was reported
to be as follows: &#8220;The charges made against me practically
accuse me of behaving like a blackguard. Well, I
can be a blackguard&mdash;probably a bigger one than any of
you are or can be, but however that may be, there is one
thing I can be, if I like, but which none of you can ever
be, and that is a gentleman. Good morning; I am
returning to England to-morrow.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE RUSSIAN SCARE AND ITS RESULTS</h3>
</div>

<p>Sir Frederick Sargood had been appointed Minister of
Defence in Victoria. He had evidently been impressed
with the success that had attended the experiment made
by the South Australian Government when they had decided
to ask the Imperial Government to lend them the
services of a regular officer to command their local troops.
He decided upon a similar course of action, but he went
a good deal further than the South Australian Government
had done. He was determined to do the thing well, and
he did it. He asked the Imperial Government for the loan
of officers to fill the following positions: (<i>a</i>) Commandant;
(<i>b</i>) Adjutant-General; (<i>c</i>) D.A.G. for Cavalry and Infantry;
(<i>d</i>) D.A.G. for Artillery; (<i>e</i>) O.C. Engineers; (<i>f</i>) Chief
Instructors for Cavalry, Infantry, Artillery and Engineers.</p>
<p>Amongst the senior officers selected by the War Office
for these posts were the following: Colonel Disney,
R.A., Lieutenant-Colonel Brownrigg, Lieutenant-Colonel
Walker, R.A., Major Fellowes and Captain Ernest
Rhodes, R.E., brother of Cecil Rhodes.</p>
<p>It was rumoured at the time that Sir Frederick had
come to the conclusion that he had undertaken rather a
serious contract in importing such a lot of officers.
How was he to protect himself against such an array
of military talent? He was a most enthusiastic volunteer.
He was besides a very able business man.
All Australians know the firm of which he was one of
the partners, Butler, Sargood and Co. His military
knowledge, however, was naturally very limited, and
no doubt he felt it would be difficult for him to battle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
against the more than heavy demands which the new
military directorate would probably make upon the
Government. It happened, however, that General
Downes&#8217; period of service with the South Australian
Government was approaching its end, and Sir Frederick
hit upon the happy idea of securing him for the position
of Secretary to his Department. The general&#8217;s ripe experience
in the conduct of the South Australian forces and
the success that had attended his efforts in that respect
rendered him well qualified to give good advice to the
Minister in charge of the Department. General Downes
accepted the appointment.</p>
<p>At the time of the Imperial officers&#8217; arrival in Melbourne
a Charity ball was being held. The wives of the new
officers bought tickets, not with the intention of going
themselves, as they thought it was just an ordinary charity
affair which would not be patronized by the best people.
So, instead of going, they gave their tickets to their servants
and sent them. If they had taken the trouble to
ask about the ball they would have been told that these
charity balls were attended by the nicest of the nice&mdash;and
they would, of course, have been there themselves. The
lady correspondents of the society journals were naturally
awaiting their arrival as excellent subjects for their pens,
and were not slow in discovering the absence of the good
ladies as well as the presence of their servants. Naturally
they felt indignant. The fact was soon whispered among
the guests, and some were unkind enough to look upon the
incident almost in the light of a personal insult. Society
was quite disturbed, and hints of boycotting the offenders
were spread about. However, full explanations were
quickly made, and the incident was forgotten.</p>
<p>Amongst the recommendations made by Sir William
Jervois, who had left South Australia early in 1882, and
had been succeeded by Sir William Robertson, brother of
Sir Hercules Robinson, was the acquisition of an up-to-date
gunboat as a beginning of a limited but efficient naval
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
unit for the defence of South Australia. At this time the
Colonies of Victoria and Queensland had started naval
units of their own. Victoria had quite, for those days, an
imposing little fleet, the flagship of which was the old
<i>Cerberus</i>. The Colony of New South Wales had not
deemed it necessary to start a fleet on its own. Sydney
was the base and headquarters of the Imperial warships
then attached to the Australian station. Consequently
they felt more than fully protected from the point of view
of naval defence. The South Australian Government gave
effect to Sir William Jervois&#8217;s recommendation, and a gunboat,
christened the <i>Protector</i>, built by the firm of Sir
William Armstrong, Newcastle-on-Tyne, was selected, and
left England on its outward-bound voyage. The citizens
of Adelaide were much interested in its arrival. This
vessel, which was still in commission two years ago, served
for many years as a training ship for the members of
the Naval Reserve. On the occasion of the taking over
of the Defence Forces of the several colonies by the Commonwealth
Government, the captain of the <i>Protector</i> became
the senior naval officer of the Naval Defence Forces.
Captain William Cresswell was afterwards appointed First
Member of the Naval Board of Control in the Commonwealth,
promoted to admiral, and knighted. Curiously
enough, he spoke Spanish. He had been born in
Gibraltar, not far from Jeréz. His sister was for many
years head of the Post Office, in fact, Postmistress-General
at the Rock.</p>
<p>Sir William Jervois&#8217;s son, my Woolwich mate, had
taken on the duties of Adjutant-General on the departure
of his father. He was completing the term of his engagement
at the time when General Downes left for Melbourne.
Pending the arrival of Lieut.-Colonel J. F. Owen, R.A.,
he was acting Commandant, and I became, for the time
being, acting Adjutant-General.</p>
<p>It was then we had a surprise. One morning the look-out
station people at Glenelg sighted columns of heavy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
smoke, evidently issuing from large craft making towards
Glenelg from the entrance to the Gulf. The fact was
communicated to the shipping and customs authorities at
Port Adelaide. They replied that they had no notification
of the intended arrival of any steamers, and none were
expected. The people at Glenelg became quite interested,
if not excited, and flocked to the jetty and the Esplanade.
The excitement spread to Adelaide, and many curious
people took train for the seaside suburb. After a time the
hulls of three large vessels gradually appeared above the
horizon. Many were the telescopes directed at them, and
very considerable the surprise when it was seen that the
vessels in question were men-of-war, but not British.
There was nothing to be done but to await their arrival.
In due time they arrived off Glenelg and anchored close
where the mail steamers usually lay when calling there.
They were flying the Russian flag. All was bustle and
excitement when they were seen lowering their boats.</p>
<p>In the meantime the customs authorities had reached
Glenelg in their steamboat from Port Adelaide, and were
awaiting instructions from the Government as to what
action they were to take. They were instructed to carry
on as usual, in the same way as when any foreign men-of-war
visited the port. The Customs House officials,
accompanied by the Port Health Officer, proceeded to the
flagship. They were met on board with all due courtesy,
and the admiral expressed his wish for permission to land
and pay his respects to the Governor and the Government
of South Australia at such time as it would be convenient
to them to receive him. On the return of the Customs
House boat the Health Officer reported that all was well
with the ships, and that he had granted them pratique.
The admiral&#8217;s message was as soon as possible conveyed
to the Government. His request was, of course, acceded
to, and a representative from the Premier&#8217;s office sent on
board to place himself in touch with the admiral. The
official visits duly took place during the afternoon. What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
reasons, if any, were given by the admiral for his sudden
appearance off the coast of South Australia I never was
told. As far as I know they were never made public,
if given. Where had they come from?</p>
<p>It soon became evident that the officers and crews were
to be treated with the ceremony and courtesy it was customary
to offer to distinguished visitors. The admiral
had given it out that the visit would be a short one. There
was to be an official dinner at Government House, the
usual reception by the Premier and members of the Government,
and official calls; and the residents of Glenelg
decided to hold a ball in their honour. Great was the
excitement, especially amongst the young ladies, at the
prospect of meeting such a large number of naval officers.
Previous to their departure the admiral and officers of the
ship gave an official dinner and an afternoon reception to
the chief residents. Then up went the anchors and away
they steamed. Where they were going was not made
known to the public, as far as I know. This unusual
event took place early in 1885.</p>
<p>While the visit lasted the excitement attending it had
kept the people&#8217;s minds fully occupied, but after the departure
of the ships people began to think what would
happen if, instead of coming in a friendly capacity, the
men-of-war had arrived with hostile intentions. To put it
very shortly and to the point, it would have meant practically
the surrender of Adelaide. There were no fortifications
at Glenelg. Though the guns on board the ships
had not sufficient range to shell the city itself, the distance
being too great, yet they could in a short time have played
havoc with Glenelg, and it may be doubted whether in
those days the Government and people would have preferred
the destruction of Glenelg to coming to some terms
with the enemy. This gave rise to much thought.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards what became popularly known
as &#8220;the Russian Scare&#8221; took place in Australia. Our
Government instructed the acting Commandant, Major
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
Jervois, to mobilize our military forces and to take up their
war positions without delay. They further gave instructions
to make a final selection of the site for the construction
of the Fort near Glenelg, the immediate preparation of the
plans, and the acquisition of the land required. A cable
was dispatched to our military adviser in London, then
General Harding-Stewart, to place at once on order the
armament for the fort, which it had been decided should
consist of two 9.2 and two 6-inch breech-loading guns,
mounted on hydro-pneumatic gun-carriages, the latest up-to-date
ordnance approved of by the home government for
coastal defence purposes throughout the Empire.</p>
<p>The mobilization was duly carried out. A couple of
days after the concentration of the forces had been completed,
and the night before the arrival of our new Commandant,
I met with a severe accident. An infantry camp
had been formed at Glenelg to protect the main road to
Adelaide. Major Jervois had arranged for an alarm to
take place early the next morning with a view of testing
how far the commanding officers of the several zones of
the defence had grasped their respective duties. The
Governor had paid a visit to the infantry camp at Glenelg
that afternoon, and had remained to take a light evening
meal at the officers&#8217; mess. It was a stirring time. Jervois
and myself were the only two staff officers available. We
had the assistance of three or four of the instructional
officers. Within three days the whole of the members of
our forces were assembled at the war stations as provided
for in our Defence Scheme, covering the probable enemy
landing places from Glenelg along the coast to the mouth
of the Port River and the approaches to the city.</p>
<p>After satisfying myself that the officers entrusted with
the defence of the Glenelg zone understood their instructions
for the alarm, I started off riding down the coast
towards Fort Glanville, intending to visit the commanding
officers in charge of the other sections, with the same object
in view. Our horses, my own and those of my orderly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
officer, had been put up at the Old Pier Hotel at Glenelg.
It was dark when we mounted, and, knowing the townships
well, I cut across several vacant allotments instead of
following the road. Suddenly I felt&mdash;as I was cantering
across one of these allotments&mdash;as if the devil himself had
gripped my face. I remembered no more till about a
couple of hours afterwards my senses came back to me.
My face was quite a picture. Some person had put up a
clothes-line during the afternoon across the vacant allotment.
The clothes-line happened to be a piece of fencing
wire. I had cantered right into it and it caught me just
above the upper lip and below my nose. That I have,
since that day, been blessed with a nose of my own is
quite a miracle. I can assure you that when I got hold
of the tip of it I could lift it quite easily from my face.</p>
<p>Some kind doctor attended to it at the Pier Hotel, and,
with the aid of many stitches and good old sticking-plaster,
dressed the wound temporarily. The rest of my face was
swollen and I was sore all over from bumping the hard
ground, as I fell, when I was dragged backwards off my
horse by the wire. However, I was much too anxious to
get on with my work to cry &#8220;Halt.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t ride, but I
ordered a buggy from the hotel and moved on. As I
reached the commanding officers of the successive sections
along the coast I created somewhat of a sensation. I was
not surprised. I presented a sorry figure, at any rate as
far as my face was concerned. However, I satisfied myself
that they had mastered their instructions, and that they
would carry them out to the best of their ability.</p>
<p>When nearing Fort Glanville I left the main road,
which ran just inside the sand-dunes and was in a very bad
condition, for the beach. The beach was good going.
Arriving close to the fort I struck inland by a track between
the dunes. I felt happier; in a few minutes I would reach
the Fort. But my troubles were not over by any means.
The young fellow who was driving me was a stranger to
those parts. I was not sure myself of the track we were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
taking. It was the custom to spread seaweed on the track
over places where the sand was too loose and the going too
heavy. As we moved along it we came to a particularly
dark spot. The lad hesitated to drive on. I couldn&#8217;t see
very well. I took the dark spot to be a patch of seaweed,
and told him to go on. We had taken the wrong track.
It was not a patch of seaweed, but a big dark hole, and into
it horse, buggy and our precious selves fell. Extricating
ourselves from the mess, satisfying ourselves that no bones
were broken, shaking out the sand from our ears and hair
and off my poor nose and face, I walked off to the Fort to
get assistance for my mate and the horse and buggy. I
hadn&#8217;t been long in my quarters when the bugles sounded
the alarm, and the commanding officer of the troops
attached to the Fort, who had been kindly attending to my
numerous bruises, left me to carry out his duty. I got
my old Irish servant to mix me a strong whisky toddy
(I don&#8217;t remember ever in my life having a drink which I
enjoyed so much) and went to bed.</p>
<p>I was glad to hear next morning from Major Jervois,
who came to see me, that the commanding officers had
successfully carried out the task set them. He was much
amused at my personal appearance. Two days afterwards
Colonel Owen arrived. I was patched up enough to be
able to ride, and accompanied him on his first tour of inspection.
He had the unique experience of arriving in his
command and finding the whole of the forces of the colony
assembled together in the vicinity of his headquarters,
Adelaide. Two more days and the scare was over. The
troops dispersed to their respective districts.</p>
<p>It was about this time that an event happened which
greatly agitated the social life of Adelaide. The wife of
a Victorian country resident had arrived in Adelaide and
had taken a house in the city. She was good-looking and
charming. She appeared to be quite well off. Her house
became a pleasant resort. She entertained well. She
delighted in giving excellent supper parties. She was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
quite a Bohemian. Her invitations included young and
old, married and single. After a short time she told her
friends that she had got divorced from her husband and
that she intended to make Adelaide her home for a time.</p>
<p>One of the leading young men fell in love with her&mdash;or
at least thought he did&mdash;and went so far, she gave out, as
to ask her to be his wife. It was evident to those who
knew him well that if he had asked her to be his wife it
had probably been after one of the jolly supper parties.
At any rate, if he had done so, he soon repented and told
her so. She was not to be denied, so she took steps to
bring a breach of promise action against him. Not content
with this, she set to work to worry him and his friends
as well. In fact, she succeeded in worrying him so much
that one day, in an ill-advised moment, he made a complaint
to the police to the effect that the lady in question
really kept a house to which they should pay special
attention. The police had to take the matter up, but they
found it difficult to get sufficient evidence to prove their
case. Finally, one night, after one of the supper-parties,
a hansom cab driver who had been ordered to call for one
of the guests arrived at the house drunk and created a
scene. It was the opportunity for the police and they laid
a charge against her.</p>
<p>The case came on before the court. Evidence was
given against her, and she was called upon for her defence.
She quietly told the magistrate that as she had been
charged with keeping a certain house she would ask for
time to prepare her defence. She further said she was
preparing a list of names of the married men, well known
in Adelaide, who had often been her guests at her supper-parties,
and that she felt sure that when the magistrate
read the names on the list he would never convict her.
We bachelors had a joyful time at the expense of the
married men. As the case had been adjourned for three
days, there was a long interval of suspense for many of
them, wondering whether their name would appear in that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
&#8220;black list.&#8221; The morning came when the case was to be
resumed. To the surprise of all and the extreme joy of the
married men in particular, she failed to appear in court.
Inquiries were made by the police, and it was found that
she had left Adelaide the previous evening. Who had
made it worth her while to disappear was never known.
She had, however, made out the list, which the Police
Commissioner received that afternoon by post. I got a
look at it myself afterwards privately, and I was wicked
enough, I suppose, to be sorry that it wasn&#8217;t published.

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE SOUDAN CONTINGENT</h3>
</div>

<p>A few months later Mrs. Barr Smith proposed to open the
new theatre and ballroom which had been added to Torrens
Park. Private theatricals and dances were to be the chief
attraction. She wished me to take the leading part in the
opening play and coach the others. I knew that I would
have to give more time, than I could really spare, to make
it a success. Further, there was always the possibility of
some untoward event happening which at the last moment
might prevent me from taking my part and probably breaking
up the show. My scruples were, however, overcome by
my hostess&#8217;s kind insistence. We set to work, and all
went happily until three nights before the date on which
<i>The Jacobite</i> was to make its first appearance. The first
dress rehearsal was to take place. Clothed in our beautiful
garments we had sat down, a merry party, to dinner.
On the whole I was fairly satisfied with my company, and
felt that with a couple more dress rehearsals it was probable
that the show would be a success.</p>
<p>At that very moment Nemesis was ringing the hall
bell. In a few minutes the butler informed me that an
orderly wished to see me. In the hall he handed me an
official letter, marked &#8220;Urgent and Confidential.&#8221; I
opened it. I have never had such a surprise in all my
life. The document was a dispatch from Lieutenant
Hawker, the officer in charge of the men at the Fort Largs,
stating that he had given some orders to the men that
afternoon and that the majority of them had refused to
obey.</p>
<p>Here was a pretty kettle of fish! From the very day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
of the raising of the force some three years before there
had not been a single instance of insubordination of any
sort. Occasional cases of overstaying leave had been
about the most serious offence that had taken place. And,
lo and behold! without any warning, without the
slightest suspicion that anything was wrong, here was
actually a &#8220;mutiny.&#8221; To leave Torrens Park at once and
say good-bye to <i>The Jacobite</i> was my duty. I gave the
butler a message for Mrs. Barr Smith, and she kindly came
out of the dining-room into one of the drawing-rooms.
Then I showed her the dispatch. I tried to convince her
that it would be better not to postpone the performance, but
to get somebody else to take up my part. As all arrangements
had been completed, and the opening night was so
close at hand, she thought we would get on all right if I
only promised to turn up on the opening night.</p>
<p>There was a feeling at the back of my head that I had
been devoting more time than I should have done to play.
Had I not made up my mind when General Downes had
told me of my first appointment to the staff that nothing
should divert my thoughts from my work? The fact that
the social obligations I had undertaken would necessitate
frequent absences from my command should have weighed
with me more. Such were my thoughts. Then there
came back vividly to my mind some words of advice which
my kinsman General Gordon, of Khartoum fame, had
given me when I first joined at Woolwich. Talking to me
one day, he told me that there were three golden rules of
life which if adhered to would lead on to success. These
rules were, first: &#8220;<i>Never allow your pleasure to interfere
with your duty</i>.&#8221; Second: &#8220;Never allow your duty to
interfere with your pleasure.&#8221; Third: &#8220;Never try to force
a woman to give you anything more than she wishes.&#8221; I
thought of these things and decided that no matter how
much annoyance I caused my good friends, there was to
be no more playtime for me till I could indulge in it
without any qualms of conscience as to the fulfilment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
of my duties. I succeeded in inducing one of the professors
of the university to come to the rescue, which
he bravely did, and the performance took place without
me.</p>
<p>I reached Fort Largs late that night after a twenty-mile
drive. I had made up my mind to leave the men
alone till the early morning, when as soon as the time came
for the early morning parade I would order them myself
to fall in. They were all in the large barrack-room ready
dressed when the time came for the usual early parade. I
walked into the room accompanied by the lieutenant and
the sergeant-major, and called out &#8220;Fall in, men&#8221;; they
went straight out on to the parade ground and fell in.
The back of the trouble was broken straightway. It was
evident to me that its cause was in a misunderstanding,
probably of a personal character, between the lieutenant
and some of the older men, who had induced the younger
soldiers to join them in the action they had taken, as they
afterwards informed me, so as to bring matters to a head.
The incident was inquired into and the evidence fully
convicted the two ringleaders. They were tried by court-martial,
sent to prison and dismissed from the force. So
ended the first and last case of insubordination that took
place during the many years that I commanded the Permanent
Artillery. However, the event had been of use to
me, as it had reminded me of General Gordon&#8217;s golden
rules.</p>
<p>The action taken by Sir Frederick Sargood in importing
the Imperial officers to Victoria was resulting in a very
considerable improvement in the military forces of that
colony. They were following on the same lines as South
Australia as regarded their constitution; a very much
higher standard of instruction, a better supervision of
detail, and competent inspection contributed to this much-desired
result.</p>
<p>Let us see what was going on in New South Wales.
The Officer Commanding the Forces was Major-General
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
Richardson, who had been in the regular forces, had retired,
and had been appointed Commandant some years
previously. The organization of the military forces of
&#8220;the Mother Colony&#8221; was being brought into line with
that of Victoria and South Australia. The other three
colonies, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania,
had been gradually following the lead given by the others,
though, as in New South Wales, they had not as yet
imported Imperial officers to take command.</p>
<p>Towards the close of 1884 the course of our campaign
in Egypt was running anything but smoothly; in fact,
the military situation was very serious and critical.
Throughout the Empire a strong feeling of apprehension
was rife, but it was left to New South Wales, the Mother
State, to be the first of England&#8217;s children to make an
offer of material help. Who first conceived the idea is not
recorded, but the credit of crystallizing and giving it effect
belongs to the late the Hon. John B. Dalley. This was not
actually the first occasion on which Australians had offered
to fight alongside English regular troops, for, at the time
of the Maori War in New Zealand, volunteers from New
South Wales and Victoria had raised units and joined in
the fighting. But such action on their part had been
looked upon as only natural. New Zealand was their
next-door neighbour, really a sister colony, and it was to
the best interests of Australia that she should be freed from
the native menace.</p>
<p>The offer to send troops from the southern to the
northern hemisphere was quite another affair. The
thought which inspired that offer could not have arisen
from any feeling of selfish interest. It was really the outward
sign of the affection and love for the Old Country
and home inherited by the colonists. Indeed, the rising
Australian generation realized what a glorious and magnificent
heritage the Mother Country had so generously
and freely entrusted to the care of the early pioneers, their
forbears. From the day when the first Englishman set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
foot in Australia and the first settlement was founded,
right up to the year 1884, when the offer was made, no
enemy had ever threatened Australia&#8217;s shores.</p>
<p>Australians rejoice that theirs is the only &#8220;virgin&#8221;
continent in this world. From the day of its birth there
had not been a drop of blood shed on its soil in the strife
of war. No other country can make so glorious a boast.
Yet it is true. It is not to be wondered at when, for the
first time for a considerable number of years, a British
army was reported to be in peril, Australia offered to share
with them the burden and heat of the day. The British
Government received the offer in the spirit in which it
was made. It conveyed to Australians that it fully
recognized the feelings of patriotism and unselfishness
which had prompted the offer, and accepted it. A contingent
composed of one battery of field artillery, one
battalion of infantry and a field ambulance, was organized
and equipped, and left Sydney Harbour in white troopships,
carrying with them the best wishes of all.</p>
<p>As a result of communications between the South
Australian and the New South Wales Governments it was
decided to send two of the transports via Melbourne and
Albany, with a promise that they would call at Adelaide
if time permitted. Later on we heard that the troops
would divert from the direct route, Melbourne to Albany,
and would pass through Backstairs Passage into the Gulf
of St. Vincent, continuing their journey through Investigator&#8217;s
Straits. They would have no time to steam up
St. Vincent&#8217;s Gulf to Adelaide, but they would &#8220;cry a
halt&#8221; for a couple of hours, taking shelter in the smooth
waters of Hogg&#8217;s Bay on the north shores of Kangaroo
Island.</p>
<p>This was as much as they could do to fulfil their
promise within their scheduled time. We arranged to
proceed to Hogg&#8217;s Bay in the <i>Protector</i> to wish them good
speed. The Government issued invitations for this historic
trip. Then the news arrived that the troopships were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
timed to reach Hogg&#8217;s Bay at one o&#8217;clock in the morning.
Fortunately the moon was nearly at its full. The <i>Protector</i>,
with its valuable cargo on board, including myself,
left Port Adelaide in the afternoon. The Government had
taken on board several tons of fruits then in season, as
well as a plentiful supply of fireworks. The worthy
commander of the <i>Protector</i> arranged the speed of the
ship so as to reach Hogg&#8217;s Bay just prior to the hour at
which the troopships were expected. It was a glorious
night, a calm sea. Presently the two white troopships
loomed up in the offing, entered the shelter of the bay,
and dropped anchor. There were no gun salutes, of
course, but from the decks of the <i>Protector</i> soared hundreds
of rockets. With bands playing the <i>Protector</i> made a
tour round the anchored troopships. Cheers upon cheers
rose from her decks, and, before their echoes could be
heard, a thousand voices on the troopships cheered in
response. Immense flares on shore lit up the sky, and the
calm surface of the sea seemed as if on fire. It was an
inspiring sight, and one not to be forgotten. The tour
round the ships being concluded, boats were lowered
from the <i>Protector</i> and visitors conveyed to the troopships.</p>
<p>Farewells took place. Though tempered by the personal
regrets of those who were being left behind, their good
wishes for their more fortunate comrades were genuine and
straight from their hearts. One last toast, &#8220;Her Majesty
the Queen&#8221;; one last song, &#8220;Auld Lang Syne.&#8221; Back
to our boats and on board the <i>Protector</i>. The noise of
the windlasses weighing the anchors was heard as the last
of us reached the <i>Protector</i>&#8217;s decks. The troopships&#8217;
whistles resounded deep on the midnight air. The engines
pulsed; the troopships moved and gathered speed. The
strains of &#8220;Rule Britannia&#8221; filled our ears, then ceased,
as the white ships, phantom-like in the haze, gradually
disappeared. We arrived back at Port Adelaide in time
for breakfast.

<p>We will not follow the contingent&#8217;s history and its
doings in Egypt, but I will quote a passage from Lord
Wolseley&#8217;s dispatch dated June 15, 1885:&mdash;</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;The Contingent&#8217;s work has been so satisfactory that
I trust that the noble and patriotic example set by New
South Wales may, should occasion arise, be followed
by other colonies.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>Lord Wolseley&#8217;s hopes have been fully realized.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A TIME OF RETRENCHMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>The term of office of General Owen began with the passing
of the &#8220;Russian scare.&#8221; The finances of the colony were
for the time being undergoing a period of depression.
Economy had to be enforced, and General Owen&#8217;s first
instructions from the Government were to recommend
ways and means of effecting reductions to meet the decrease
in the military vote. Major Jervois&#8217;s period of
service as adjutant-general came to an end about this
time, and the Commandant was informed that it was not
proposed to have him replaced by another officer from
England.</p>
<p>It was not practicable to carry on the administration
without some qualified officer to assist the Commandant
with his duties. The inspections of the country units by
the Commandant at least once a year were necessary under
the provisions of the Defence Act. During the periods
of his absence on inspection tours the presence of a
qualified deputy at headquarters was necessary. To overcome
this difficulty he asked me if I would undertake
the duties of adjutant-general in addition to those as
Officer Commanding the Permanent Artillery. My answer
was that I would do my best. So it came about that in
some three years from my first appointment I had reached
the position of practically Second-in-Command. The
fulfilment of my vision seemed to be coming more quickly
than my wildest dreams ever expected.</p>
<p>To carry out retrenchment is ever an unpleasant and
thankless job, and the first six months of our new régime
was no exception to the rule. If you remember, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
military forces of the colony comprised no less than four
separate systems&mdash;the Regulars or Permanent Artillery,
the partially paid force, the Volunteers, and the rifle clubs.
Each of them was serving under different regulations.
Each also had its own interests to safeguard, and each
its staunch supporters. As the pruning knife began its
work, so, violent opposition arose from those to whom it
was being applied. Presently, as the knife kept on
moving, dissatisfaction became general. The supporters
of each system wished for the retrenchment of the others
and the maintenance of their own. This, of course, was
specially the case with the partially paid and the volunteer
forces. The first claimed that, with their greater efficiency,
if the numbers were somewhat increased the colony would
have a more reliable force than if the Volunteers were
retained. On the other hand, the Volunteers claimed that,
with more instruction and drill, they could be depended
on to fight all right if the necessity arose, and the saving
made by abolishing the pay of the partially paid forces
would accomplish all the economy desired by the
Government.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards the annual session of Parliament
opened, with the usual &#8220;floods of talk.&#8221; Members who
were really concerned for the forces were up and fighting
in the interests of the special system of retrenchment they
advocated; the Government were disinclined to stick to
their guns and insist upon the question being one for
the Government to deal with. The result was the common
one in such cases&mdash;the appointment of a Royal Commission
to inquire into and report upon the conduct of the
forces for the past year, and make such recommendations
for retrenchment as the Commission should deem advisable.
With the very limited staff at my disposal the strain
became very severe. In addition the Commandant&#8217;s
temper did not improve with these happenings. He was
a bachelor, and had not the opportunities a married man
has of forgetting official troubles when enjoying the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
comfort and happiness of his home. However, we pulled
through, though the Commission sat for some considerable
time, during which no amount of returns seemed to
satisfy its cravings for information. The report of the
Commission was by-and-by duly printed and submitted
to the Government, which promised to lay it before
Parliament on a suitable date for the information of
Members, and after that the Government would make the
opportunity for the fullest discussion by the House.</p>
<p>With the close of the year 1888 would come the completion
of General Owen&#8217;s three years&#8217; agreement with
the Government. This agreement set out that at the end
of three years the term of service could be further extended
by two years by mutual consent.</p>
<p>Month after month passed away. The Commission
sent in its report. When it was discussed in the House
no final conclusion was arrived at. A second Commission
was appointed, and by the time its report was presented
to the Government and the House met, General Owen&#8217;s
term of three years was coming to a close. It is not to
be wondered that the condition of the forces was unsatisfactory,
their numbers reduced, recruiting stopped, equipment
wearing out, schools of instruction held only at
rare intervals. It was a disheartening time for all of us.
Enthusiasm lacked, and the officers and men were sick
at heart.</p>
<p>As it was expedient for General Owen to notify the
Imperial Government as to his future movements, he
thought it advisable to approach Mr. Playford, then
Minister of Defence, on the subject of the two years&#8217;
extension. The Hon. Thomas Playford, popularly known
as &#8220;Honest Tom,&#8221; had been brought up working on his
father&#8217;s market garden, which was situated in the hills
not far from Morialta, the home of the Bakers. He was
a great, tall, powerful, heavy man, much above the average
size. At their interview General Owen referred to the
terms of his agreement and diplomatically sought to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
discover whether the Government were agreeable to the
two years&#8217; extension. As I have pointed out, the
general&#8217;s term of office had not been too happy a one.
The report of the Commissions and the discussions in
Parliament had given rise to a considerable amount of
friction and many adverse comments in the Press. Mr.
Playford pointed out to him that as Parliament was to
be prorogued before Christmas he thought it advisable
not to settle the question for the time being. He suggested
that the general should reopen it after the prorogation.
The Government would then be in recess, and
as the House would not be sitting, no disagreeable questions
could be raised by members. By making no final
decision before the prorogation he, as Minister, was in
a position, in case questions were asked, to reply that
nothing had been decided, and that the matter was under
the consideration of the Government. The general told me
about this interview, and, talking it over, we came to
the conclusion&mdash;especially as Mr. Playford had suggested
to the general not to press for an answer just then&mdash;that
he wished to reopen negotiations after the prorogation of
the House, and that it was his intention to agree to the
extension.</p>
<p>Parliament was prorogued. The general then sent an
official letter to Mr. Playford, reopening the matter, concluding
with a statement to the effect that if the Government
were agreeable he, on his part, was prepared to
carry on. He received no acknowledgment of his letter,
but he did read next morning in the papers a statement,
evidently inspired, to the effect that &#8220;the Commandant,
General Owen, had notified the Ministerial head of the
Department that he was willing to continue his duties
for two years if the Government so desired. The Government,
however, did <i>not</i> see their way to meet the general&#8217;s
wishes.&#8221; I shall never forget that morning. The general
came to the office in his uniform. As a rule he wore
plain clothes unless he was on some special duty. I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
not surprised at the state of mind he was in. The paragraph,
on the face of it, and in the absence of any
acknowledgment of the general&#8217;s letter, and considering
the tenor of their interview early in December, appeared
to be in the nature of a direct insult, almost premeditated.
I sent off an orderly to the Government offices with a letter
from the general requesting an interview with Mr. Playford
as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The answer came back that the Minister was ready
to see General Owen at once. Off went the general. I
returned to my room, sat down, lit a pipe and began
to think. It was not long before I heard him return. I
didn&#8217;t wait to be sent for. I walked straight into his
room. He was in such a temper that he could hardly
speak. I felt that his interview must have been a very
painful one. So it had. It had not been long. He told
me the only few words that had taken place. The general
appeared to have made some remark to the effect that
it seemed to him that if the paragraph in the newspapers
had been supplied by the Minister, or with his approval,
such action was a direct insult, not only to himself personally,
but also to the uniform he had the honour to
wear.</p>
<p>The answer the general received from Mr. Playford
fairly astonished me. It was something to the effect that
&#8220;if the general had asked to see him to insult him, the
sooner he left the room the better, or he would <i>kick</i> him
out.&#8221; Nothing would suit the general for the moment but
to send for the representatives of the Press and give them
an account of the interview. I succeeded in altering his
mind, and suggested that he should see the Chief Justice
and the Governor first, and obtain their advice as to what
action he should take.</p>
<p>This he did, and, as far as I remember, the unfortunate
incident was never made public.</p>
<p>The general made his plans for returning to England
at once. General Owen subsequently filled many important
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
appointments. He was selected some years afterwards
as Commandant of the Colony of Queensland. He
was determined to get back on the South Australians and
show them that there were other people in the world who
appreciated his services, even if Mr. Playford and Co.
had not done so. He afterwards commanded the artillery
at Malta, and for a time was Acting-Governor of the
island. Later on he held the position of president of the
Ordnance Committee, the most scientific committee that
I know of in our service.</p>
<p>Years later on it fell to me to have a tussle with
Honest Tom when he was Minister for Defence in the
Federal Government. About this more anon.</p>
<p>Immediately the general informed me of his decision
to leave for England, the first thought that naturally
came to my mind was, &#8220;Who is going to succeed him
as Commandant?&#8221; I took steps to find out whether the
Government had communicated by cable to England for
a successor. They had not done so. That they had not
taken any action in the matter seemed to me to point to
the fact that the unfortunate words uttered in the interview
which had ended so unhappily had not been premeditated
by the Government; otherwise, one would think,
they would have taken some steps to secure a successor.
I bethought myself of our old Commandant, General
Downes, then secretary to Sir Frederick Sargood in
Victoria. I knew personally, from conversations that I
had had with him during my visits to Melbourne, that
the duties he was performing were not congenial to him.
I at once wrote to him confidentially, told him of the
catastrophe that had overtaken us, and asked him straight
whether he was willing to take up the command in South
Australia again if it was offered to him. He answered,
&#8220;Yes, certainly, if it is offered.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t possibly
approach Playford in the matter. Playford, according to
the general&#8217;s account, had been much too rude to my
Commandant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>But there are always ways&mdash;quite straight, not crooked&mdash;of
approaching those in power. Sufficient to say that
the Government decided to offer the appointment to
General Downes. During my conversations with those
who had at the time the reins of Government in their
hands it was suggested to me that I should be a candidate
for the position. What an alluring prospect! Was my
vision to come true so quickly? Though my work under
General Owen had given him full satisfaction, and I had
a good hold of all the senior commanding officers, I felt
that it was too early in the day for me to accept so heavy
a responsibility. I could afford to wait. Hence my suggestion
to the Government to reappoint General Downes.</p>
<p>An interval of some two months took place from the
time of General Owen&#8217;s departure and the arrival of
General Downes from Melbourne. During this period I
was appointed Acting Commandant, and I took my seat
in that very chair in which General Downes had sat on
the day he told me of my first appointment. The vision
had been temporarily fulfilled. It was to be confirmed
later on.</p>
<p>The first task I set to myself as Acting Commandant
was to make a very close examination into the state of
our finances. The official financial year closed on
June 30.</p>
<p>The annual continuous camps of training were held
during the Easter holidays. I determined to strain every
effort to hold a record camp, at which every member of
the force should be present. As soon as I was satisfied
that I could carry out my wishes I wrote to General
Downes, asking him to arrive in Adelaide, if suitable,
the day after the troops had assembled in camp for their
annual training, when I would hand over the command
to him. All went well. I selected a site at a place called
Keswick, near the Black Forest, just west of Adelaide.
It was the locality that had been fixed upon in the local
defence scheme for the assembly of the troops in case
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
of invasion. We had a full muster. The general arrived
and took command. He was welcomed by the officers and
men alike. My responsibilities for the time being were
over.</p>
<p>The success of General Downes&#8217;s previous term of
command was a big factor in assisting him to obtain
support from the Government and the public at large,
and a somewhat generous increase in the military vote
was made available. His first request to the Government
was for the assistance of an Imperial officer as adjutant-general
to relieve me from the onerous double duties I
had fulfilled for three years during Owen&#8217;s term of office.
The Government concurred at once. A cable was sent
home. Within a few days the general was notified that
Major Lovett, Somersetshire Light Infantry, had been
appointed and was sailing at once from London for
Adelaide. On his arrival I handed over to him my
duties as adjutant-general.</p>
<p>General Downes was fully aware of the six years&#8217; work
that had fallen to my lot since the fateful January 2, 1882,
the day on which he had notified me of my first appointment.
He had, of course, watched from Victoria with
keen interest our difficult and troublous times for the three
years past.</p>
<p>With his usual forethought and kindness he suggested
I should apply for six months&#8217; leave. I thanked him
heartily and sent in my application.</p>
<p>It was approved.</p>
<p>Oh, what joy!

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>MY VISION FULFILLED</h3>
</div>

<p>My voyage homewards on the <i>Valetta</i> was indeed a contrast
to the three months spent on the good old clipper,
the <i>Waipa</i>, on my way to New Zealand.</p>
<p>I had arrived in New Zealand in November, 1879, as
you know, with practically nothing before me but a determined
and firm resolve to make good somehow, without
any assistance except that which I could give myself.
Within ten years I was returning home, with a record of
service of which I could be proud.</p>
<p>Within those ten years I had held the position of
Acting Commandant of an important colony, with the
temporary rank of full colonel, and was going home with
the rank of major. If I had remained in the good old
regiment I would have been fortunate if I had got my
captaincy within that period. But what about the knowledge
and experience I had gained, not only as a gunner,
but as a staff officer, and, yet more, as an officer charged
with grave responsibilities in the administration and
command of troops, organized and maintained on lines
differing totally from the hard and fast methods governing
our Regular Army, but eminently suitable to the
economic conditions of the healthy young colonies whose
citizens were true to the core at heart in their patriotism
and were ready to make many sacrifices to maintain the
might of the Motherland?</p>
<p>For seven years my home had been in Adelaide. My
friends had always cheered me on in my work. If
the exuberance of youth, good health and the happiest
of surroundings&mdash;all friends, and no foes that I knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
of&mdash;had not made my life happy, the fault would have
been my own. I am moralizing&mdash;the one thing I have
been trying to avoid all through my tale. What really
is in my mind is to point out to any youngster who reads
this, and whose future suddenly becomes blurred and
may appear hopeless, that if he relies on his own self,
gives his truest instincts fair play, and determines to
beat his bad luck and give to himself his best, he will
more than likely succeed, as it was my good fortune
to do.</p>
<p>Now let us get back on board the ss. <i>Valetta</i>, on the
moonlight night when she weighed anchor off Largs Bay
and I bade &#8220;adios&#8221; to the many friends who had accompanied
me on board, and who, re-embarking on the
Customs launch, followed the vessel down the gulf till
the evening shades hid them from our sight. The five
weeks spent on the <i>Valetta</i> on the homeward trip were
indeed enjoyable. First, the weather was fine all the
way. I do not think we had one really rough day. The
ship was full; not an empty berth. A &#8220;land boom&#8221; was
on at the time; there was plenty of money about, and
most of the passengers were well-to-do men taking their
families home to have a good time. Land booms I have
heard described as speculations in land, owing to which
men with, say, a few hundred pounds quickly become
possessed of as many thousands (on paper, not in land).
Presently the boom cracks, the thousands disappear. I
am sorry to say that this actually happened later on to
several of our passengers.</p>
<p>We arrived at Brindisi, and thence went overland to
Calais; then Dover and good old London. What a
pleasure it was to get back to the old club, stay at the
old hotel, sit in the little balcony at Morley&#8217;s, gaze at
Nelson&#8217;s monument, and walk round the old haunts!
After a few days&#8217; stay in London I went home to Wardhouse.</p>
<p>I had undertaken only one official matter to inquire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
into during my absence on leave. It was to report upon
the method then in vogue for the supply of warlike material
to the colonies. This method was as follows. An officer,
at that time General Harding-Stewart, retired, was acting
as military adviser and inspector of warlike stores to the
several colonies. When any of the colonies ordered rifles,
guns or other requirements, he procured them in London,
working on commission. No doubt he meant well, but
at the time I left Adelaide there were hardly two heavy
guns alike in any of the colonies. A climax had been
reached when New South Wales ordered two 10-inch
muzzle-loaders similar to the two which South Australia
had mounted at Fort Glanville. The New South Wales
guns were supplied by the same firm. They arrived in
Sydney and were mounted at Middle Head Fort. I
visited Sydney at the time they were being mounted,
and found that their calibre differed from the South
Australian guns by a fraction of an inch, so that the
ammunition was not interchangeable. As a matter of
fact, there were but few guns of Imperial pattern in the
whole of Australia; we were armed mostly with experimental
guns of private firms.</p>
<p>As a result of my inquiries I came to the conclusion
that it would be more satisfactory if a senior officer on
the active list of the Royal Regiment of Artillery was
appointed at a fixed salary for a term of years, who would
be instructed, at any rate in the case of heavy ordnance,
field guns and rifles, to supply none except of a pattern
passed into the Imperial Service itself. This recommendation
was submitted by me to my Premier at Adelaide on
my return, passed on by him to the other Premiers concerned,
and finally given effect to, and Lieut. Colonel
King-Harman, R.A., was appointed. Little did I think
that, within ten years, I myself was to receive the
appointment.</p>
<p>I had also intended to pay a visit to the Expeditionary
Force at that time operating up the Nile. But the relief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
or fall of Khartoum was imminent, and the time at my
disposal was not sufficient. Khartoum fell and General
Gordon was murdered. Who was to blame? I wonder.
Have you ever been to see and studied the statue raised
to his memory in Trafalgar Square, a replica of which
stands in Spring Gardens, Melbourne? If not, do so
some day, and look well into his face. Its expression
is one of sad thought. So might he have looked as he
stood in Khartoum facing death.</p>
<p>I must pass over the glorious days I spent at
home; they were the last I spent with my father and
mother.</p>
<p>Taking my passage by the <i>Massilia</i>, a sister ship to
the <i>Valetta</i>, I set out once more for the fair lands of the
South, happy and contented, mentally and physically
refreshed, and determined to rise still higher in my profession.
On my arrival at Adelaide I received a right
royal welcome. I found General Downes going strong.
There had been no more talk of Royal Commissions.
Major Lovett had settled down to his work and was a
general favourite; he himself liked Adelaide immensely.
More funds had been made available; my own Permanent
Artillery had behaved well during my absence and were
doing well. For the next two years nothing occurred out
of the usual, either in South Australia or the other colonies,
from a military point of view. The end of 1891 was
approaching; the general decided to retire. Major Lovett
had completed his term as adjutant-general and was returning
home. I was asked to step into the breach once
more and take up his duties as well as my own. I, of
course, agreed, and I was promoted to lieutenant-colonel
early in 1892.</p>
<p>The Premier of South Australia was then Charles
Cameron Kingston, or, to give him his full title, which
he dearly loved, Sergeant Charles Cameron Kingston,
B Company, 1st Regiment, Adelaide Rifles. Kingston
possessed a charming personality. He was a most able
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
lawyer, could see through most things and most people,
could analyse a difficult subject, select what was good,
discard what was bad, quicker than most men. As a
politician he was highly successful. Rough old Seddon
of New Zealand might be reckoned as his closest rival.
As a lawyer he was sound as a bell, a most eminent
draftsman, and a mighty quick worker when he liked,
though he was not a model of industry. As a sergeant
he was tip-top. B Company was the best company in
the regiment; he seldom missed a parade. As a &#8220;sport&#8221;
he was loved by old and young. They spoke of him as
&#8220;Good old Charlie.&#8221;</p>
<p>General Downes, when leaving, made up his mind to
recommend to the Government to secure the services of
another Imperial officer on the active list to succeed him
who should take over the command before the actual date
of his own retirement. Personally I must say I was
rather surprised at the general&#8217;s action, for by this time
I had full confidence that I could carry out the duties
myself. I had not by any means wasted all my time
during my leave two years before; I had got much information.
Then I had been instrumental in obtaining
for him his second term of command, notwithstanding
that he had retired from the active list himself when he
had taken up the duties of secretary to Sir Frederick
Sargood. So I had hoped that, while he might express
his opinion to the Government, he would not insist on
it too much. I must admit that he was quite frank with
me as to the attitude he was taking up. His argument
was to this effect. It had been found necessary before
to supersede local officers. &#8220;Surely,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the same
considerations that held good then hold good now. I do
not say that you are not qualified to fill the position, but
if you are appointed it will form a precedent, and, on the
expiry of the terms of the engagements of the Imperial
officers in the other colonies the claims of local officers
will again naturally be put forward. Then good-bye to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
the system of obtaining the services of thoroughly experienced
officers who have no local interests and no axes
to grind.&#8221; Meantime, the senior commanding officers of
several branches of our forces were, without my knowledge,
beginning to interest themselves to have me appointed as
successor to the general.</p>
<p>To return to Sergeant Charles Cameron Kingston, let
me tell of an incident which may give you some insight
into the personal character of a remarkable man. It is
one which, except for an accident, might have had fatal
results. Kingston was leading the Government at the
time; Sir Richard Baker of Morialta was President of the
Upper House. Kingston had introduced a Bill in the
House of Representatives dealing with arbitration in
industrial disputes. Sir Richard Baker was the father of
a Bill introduced into the Senate on the same subject.
While the aims of the two were identical, the methods by
which those results were to be obtained were by no means
analogous. Each Bill had its supporters in each House.
As the debates proceeded considerable bitterness arose,
ending in correspondence in the daily Press. Finally,
Kingston and Baker commenced to abuse each other in
print. Kingston&#8217;s temper gave out. He wrote a letter to
Sir Richard which he had delivered at the latter&#8217;s office
in Victoria Square, together with a case containing a pistol
and some cartridges. He could no longer stand what he
considered the insults Sir Richard had thought fit to level
at him. The letter stated that he would be on the pavement
on the opposite side of the street to the entrance to
Sir Richard&#8217;s office at five minutes to twelve o&#8217;clock, noon,
next day, Saturday, and asked Sir Richard to take up a
position on the pavement outside his offices at that hour,
bringing his pistol with him. As soon as the post office
clock, which was close to the office, began to strike twelve,
each would step into the roadway and shoot at his leisure.
A quaint duel, was it not?</p>
<p>The accident which saved the situation was the fact
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
that Sir Richard was not in the habit of attending his
office on Saturday morning. His son, or someone in the
office, opened Kingston&#8217;s letter, and the police were informed.
Shortly before noon Kingston was seen walking
across from the Government Offices towards Baker&#8217;s
offices. Two constables in plain clothes followed him and
watched him as he coolly took up his stand on the pavement.
The hands of the post office clock pointed at three
minutes to twelve. The two constables walked up to Mr.
Kingston. They politely asked him what his business was.
&#8220;I am just waiting for Baker to come out of his office,&#8221; he
answered; &#8220;then you will see some sport. I advise you
to move a bit to one side. I don&#8217;t think he is much of a
shot. He might get one of you two.&#8221; The constables,
who were well known to Kingston, informed him that Sir
Richard had not been to his office that morning, so that
there would be no sport, but they had instructions from
the Commissioner of Police to arrest him for attempting
to commit a breach of the peace, and to take him at once
before a magistrate. Within half an hour he appeared
before a police magistrate, had his pistol taken from him,
and was bound over to keep the peace for six months.</p>
<p>In the meantime the news had spread throughout
Adelaide like wildfire, and had reached Sir Richard at the
Adelaide Club. Kingston&#8217;s letter and the revolver which
accompanied it had been sent down to the club from Sir
Richard&#8217;s office after twelve o&#8217;clock. No sooner had Sir
Richard been told of what had happened than he put the
revolver Kingston had sent him into his pocket, borrowed
another at the club, and started off to look for his challenger,
who, he knew, usually lunched at Parliament
House and would at this time probably be walking down
King William Street from the Government Offices in
Victoria Square. He was not mistaken, for after proceeding
a short way up King William Street he came face
to face with Kingston. &#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I was not
at my office this morning, but here I am now. Stand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
off, and the first one who counts five aloud can shoot
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said Kingston, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t oblige you;
the police have taken away my revolver.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Baker, &#8220;here is the one you sent
me,&#8221; handing it over to him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it will go
off. I have one of my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was now time to interfere. Three of us who had
followed Sir Richard out from the club stepped in and
good counsels prevailed. As Kingston had been bound
over to keep the peace for six months no duel could take
place. As a matter of fact, it was not long before the two
redoubtable belligerents shook hands and had a friendly
laugh over the incident.</p>
<p>Now comes the sequel. By the Regulations under the
Military Act, any member of the forces convicted of an
offence in a civil court was liable to dismissal. On the
Monday morning a full report of the case appeared in the
newspapers. Before this took place General Downes had
retired and I was once more acting Commandant. The
officer who was acting Adjutant-General brought the newspaper
report under my notice officially. There was no
other course but to order Sergeant Kingston to be put
under arrest and called upon to make a statement, if he so
wished, before he was dismissed from the forces, in accordance
with the Regulations. This order I gave. The
Attorney-General at the time, Mr. Homburgh, was very
much concerned at my order. A doubt then entered my
mind as to whether being bound over to keep the peace
amounted to a conviction under the provisions of the
Defence Act Regulations. I immediately referred the
question to the Crown Solicitor, who said it was a difficult
question I had raised, but ruled finally that being bound
over to keep the peace was not tantamount to a conviction
within the meaning of the Regulations. Whether this
was sound law or not I cannot say, but it gave me the
opportunity to let Sergeant Kingston off easily. I at once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
sent orders to his commanding officer to warn the sergeant
to appear before me at the Staff Office the next morning,
so that I could deal with the case.</p>
<p>I thought the incident was over, and got ready for my
dinner. As I was entering the dining-room at the Club
Sir Jenkin Coles, the Speaker of the House, a close friend
of Kingston&#8217;s, spoke to me about it. I told him the
decision of the Crown Solicitor left the matter in Kingston&#8217;s
favour; he had been ordered to appear before me in
accordance with the usual custom of the Service to be
finally dealt with. Sir Jenkin asked me if this was necessary.
&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;if Sergeant Kingston signs a
statement to the effect that he is satisfied with the cause of
his being placed under arrest and the action taken in this
matter by the military authorities I don&#8217;t want to see him
at the office.&#8221; No sooner had I said this than Sir Jenkin
rose from the dinner table to return in ten minutes with a
written statement, signed by Kingston, to the effect that he
was quite satisfied with the action taken by the authorities.
So ended this extraordinary episode, but I was told by a
good many friends that I had driven a nail in my coffin as
regarded the Commandantship. The appointment was
practically in Kingston&#8217;s hand. But those friends of mine
did not know him.</p>
<p>General Downes left Adelaide. The Government gave
no indication of their intentions re the appointment of his
successor. The mayor&#8217;s official ball took place. Charles
Cameron Kingston was talking to the Governor. He
beckoned me and said: &#8220;I have just informed His Excellency
that the Government have appointed you a colonel
and Commandant of our forces.&#8221; His Excellency warmly
congratulated me. I thanked Kingston.</p>
<p>My vision was fulfilled.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE GREAT STRIKES</h3>
</div>

<p>In 1890 the great maritime strike had its birth in Sydney.
The original strikers were the wharf labourers, who paralysed
all business. The strike spread rapidly to practically
all the chief ports of Australia. The Government at
Sydney trusted more to the support of the merchants and
producers, whose interests were being so assailed, than to
the power that lay in their hands to tackle the strikers by
the aid of the military forces. The police, under the able
guidance of Mr. Fosberry, then Chief Commissioner, did
their work splendidly, but the situation became too critical.
Bank managers, insurance agents, squatters, architects
and others took off their coats and waistcoats, loaded and
unloaded the trolleys, and worked like common labourers.
The farthest point that the Government would go towards
assisting the police in keeping order was to detail a
restricted number of mounted riflemen to protect the
willing volunteer workers from the assaults of the strikers.</p>
<p>In sympathy with the action taken in Sydney the
Wharfmen&#8217;s Unions in all the other chief ports of Australia
joined their comrades, and Port Adelaide became a
head centre. Previous to this the South Australian
Government had entered into an agreement with the
Government of Western Australia to train some fifty
Permanent Force Artillerymen to garrison the newly
constructed forts at Albany. This detachment were just
completing their time at Largs Fort, so that the little
Permanent Force under my command in South Australia
numbered some 130, of all ranks. The strikers at Port
Adelaide set to work with a good will. Every vessel in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
the harbour was picketed, every approach to the wharves
guarded. Business was at an absolute standstill. Large
mass meetings of strikers were held morning and afternoon.
The police, under Mr. Peterswald, reinforced by
a large draft from the country districts, could do no more
than just maintain order. The situation was more than
serious. Mr. Peterswald ventured to appear at a mass
meeting one afternoon, hoping that he might cast a little
oil on the troubled waters. He came out on the balcony
of a hotel, facing the huge crowd of strikers. A quaint
scene followed. Some wags called out, &#8220;Take off your
hat, Peter.&#8221; They wanted to get authority&mdash;as personified
by the Commissioner&mdash;to bow to them. Peterswald
quickly recognized the position and, lifting his hat, said
to them: &#8220;I am glad to meet you, men. I hope you will
go back to your work and put an end to this serious
trouble,&#8221; and quickly left the balcony. The majority
cheered and laughed. But their leaders were on the job.
The word was passed on to the strikers that, about twelve
o&#8217;clock that night, they would receive definite instructions
from their section leaders as to their future action. All
their pickets and guards were doubled that night, and
specially the guard on the railway bridge across the Port
River, which connected Port Adelaide with the shore and
the forts.</p>
<p>During that afternoon I had given instructions that
every available man of our Permanent Force was to
assemble at Fort Glanville, with a view to a gun competition
next day. Parliament was sitting. I was at Fort
Glanville, much occupied in laying down the conditions
for next day&#8217;s gun practice. In the course of the evening
Mr. Playford, the Defence Minister, telephoned me from
Parliament House to be ready to march with my men
under arms to Port Adelaide. As this was the first time
that&mdash;as far as I knew&mdash;an order had been issued by any
Australian Government to its permanent troops to march
under arms to assist the police in quelling civil riots, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
asked that the instructions should be sent to me in writing.
The final words I heard on the telephone were, &#8220;Your
instructions will reach you by a mounted orderly in plenty
of time for you to act.&#8221;</p>
<p>At about eleven o&#8217;clock that evening the mounted orderly
arrived, and at three in the morning&mdash;it was summer time, a
moonlight night, practically as clear as day&mdash;we marched
out of the fort on our way to Port Adelaide, where I found
close on 400 police, mounted and foot, all armed. The
Government had, therefore, some 500 armed men to cope
with the strikers if they persisted in carrying out their
threats. Half-past five came. It was daylight. The
inspector in charge of the police patrols which had been
posted the previous evening at all important bridges and
approaches to the wharves suggested that I should accompany
him to view the situation. We rode out together.
Nobody was to be seen; the port was as quiet as
if it were Sunday morning. The strike leaders had
become fully aware of the determination of the Government
to deal firmly with any attempt on their
part to disturb the public peace, and had deemed
discretion the better part of valour. The strike was
virtually over, and, after providing a good breakfast for
my men, we marched back to Fort Glanville in peace and
quiet. This was the only instance that I am aware of in
the history of the Australian colonies when the members
of the Permanent Forces were actually called out and
marched under arms to the assistance of the civil power.
Let us hope it will be the last.</p>
<p>Hardly were these troubles over when another large
body of Australian workers held up one of Australia&#8217;s
chief industries. The shearers, the clippers of the fleeces,
struck work. The shearers are a roving crowd, who move
from north to south of Australia&#8217;s vast territory and back
again. Most of them are well known to the squatters who
employ them. The same old story&mdash;more wages, better
conditions of living. My own opinions as to the rights
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
and wrongs of the shearers&#8217; claims may be of no value,
but my sympathies were certainly on their side as regarded,
at least, the conditions of living at the sheds.</p>
<p>I had had personal experience of how quickly utter
ruin falls upon the squatter. It is a question often of
living in affluence one day and having not a penny left
within nine months. To record the names of the squatters
personally known to myself who had thus suffered would
be a sad task. They were many. However, their failure
was not brought about by the demands of the shearers.
The granting of these demands in prosperous times could
not have much hurt the interests of their employers.
Providence has a special gift of casting ruin at times
broadcast, without, as far as we mortals can tell, any
reason or rhyme. A few inches of rain, falling at the
right time of the year in any part of Australia, ensures a
plentiful supply of green feed and prevents the enormous
ravages amongst stock of all kinds which a drought
causes.</p>
<p>The squatters fought their battle hard against the
shearers in 1891. In Queensland they had a sympathetic
Government at the time. The maritime strike had left a
nasty taste in the mouths of the producers. The export
trade had been held up, and the necessaries of life imported
from abroad had been denied to the country districts. It
was decided to adopt hard, repressive measures.</p>
<p>The Government summoned to their aid the Mounted
Rifles. These were chiefly recruited in the country districts,
and most of them were producers themselves, and
the strike broke down.</p>
<p>It was just about this time that I accompanied His
Excellency Lord Kintore, an old friend and neighbour
from Aberdeenshire&mdash;then our Governor in South Australia&mdash;as
far as Brisbane. Lord Kintore had, some time
previously, arranged to proceed by sea to Port Darwin
and undertake the overland journey from there to Adelaide
through the northern territory, which was then under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
administration of the South Australian Government. It
was a big undertaking, and by no means a pleasure trip.
We arrived in Brisbane, but, owing to the breaking down
of the ss. <i>Chingtu</i>, we had a delay of some days in that
fair capital of what will undoubtedly be in the future one
of the richest of the Australian States.</p>
<p>We rather taxed the splendid efforts of our hospitable
friends by the length of our stay. But they were not to
be beaten. Strike or no strike, they laid themselves out
to give us as much joy as it was possible to do in the
time. I laid the foundation of many lasting friendships
within those few days. Then the <i>Chingtu</i>, with Lord
Kintore on board, left for Port Darwin, and I made my
way backward to Adelaide.</p>
<p>The Melbourne Cup Meeting of 1891 was a fateful one
for me, for I had the happiness of becoming engaged to
be married. I had known my future wife for several
years. She had been born in Victoria. Her father hailed
from County Galway, having emigrated to South Australia
with his brother, the late Hon. Nicholas Fitzgerald, than
whom no public man in Australia was ever held in higher
esteem by all classes. The brothers made Burra Burra,
then a prosperous copper field to the north of Adelaide,
their first hunting-ground. From there they moved on
to Victoria, in the days of the discovery of the goldfields&mdash;Ballarat,
Castlemaine, Kyneton and Bendigo. At the
time I married they had prospered well enough. Later
on they lost&mdash;for want of food and water&mdash;some 400,000
sheep on the various stations they were interested in. My
wife and I had hopes of buying old Wardhouse, in
Aberdeenshire, from my Spanish nephew. These hopes
went by the board. Ours was by no means a singular
experience in the history of Australian pioneers in the
back country. I know of many friends who&mdash;if possible&mdash;fared
worse.</p>
<p>I was married on February 29, 1892. At the conclusion
of our honeymoon, which we spent at Gracedale House,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
close to the Blackspur range of hills, Victoria, we returned
to Adelaide, and once again I became a resident at the
Largs Bay Hotel.</p>
<p>When I look back to those happy days I feel thankful
that my term of office cost me but small worry. I happened
to be successful in maintaining quite cordial relations
with the successive occupants of the ministerial chair. I
was not hampered by any serious reduction in our financial
vote. I was not troubled by any especially adverse
criticisms on the conduct of the forces, either in Parliament
or in the Press. I was able to carry out reforms which
led the way to the adoption of the &#8220;Universal Service
System&#8221; now in vogue in the great Commonwealth of
Australia.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE INTRODUCTION OF &#8220;UNIVERSAL <br />SERVICE,&#8221; AND TWO VOYAGES <br />HOME<br /></h3>
</div>

<p>From the very time that I took over the duties of my first
appointment I had thought that a considerable improvement
could be made in the organization of the existing
forces. I had encouraged the formation of cadet corps,
as far as lay in my power, and I had been splendidly supported
by the Education Department in my efforts, with
the result that, when I assumed the command, the cadet
system was a flourishing institution. The success that
attended the cadet movement, the support given to it by
the parents, and the keen enthusiasm of the youngsters
in their work, led me to think that the time was ripe for
the introduction of a universal system of National Service,
the ultimate aim of which was to ensure that every youth
should, by the time that he had reached the age of manhood,
twenty-five years, have undergone a course of training,
which, without interfering with his civil avocation,
would render him a desirable asset as a soldier. With
this object in view I submitted a scheme to the Government.</p>
<p>General Hutton, who had by this time been appointed
Commandant of New South Wales, arranged a conference
of the Commandants of the States in Sydney to discuss
several important matters in connexion with the defence
of Australia as a whole. Two very important agenda
were: (<i>a</i>) the necessity for determining the nature of the
heavy armaments of the forts, in point of uniformity and
efficiency, and (<i>b</i>) the co-ordination of the several systems
of enlistment then in vogue throughout the States.</p>
<p>I informed my brother Commandants that I intended
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
to recommend my Government to merge our Volunteers
into the partially paid force, which would be a substantial
move towards the simplification of the conditions of service.
Further, I suggested that if the South Australian
Government carried out the proposed change it would
assist them materially towards effecting a similar change
in their own colonies.</p>
<p>I did not, however, deem it advisable to mention the
plans I had with reference to the introduction of universal
service, for the change was a radical one. I knew that
if any suspicion arose that it was proposed to introduce
a form of military service compelling citizens by law to
devote no matter how small a portion of their own time to
military training, such proposals would at once be looked
upon as simply an insidious way of creating conscription,
a compulsory system of service&mdash;a form of service
absolutely distasteful and foreign to us British, and even
more so to British colonists. It was therefore necessary
for me to take the greatest care very gradually to prepare
and school the public mind so that the term &#8220;National
Service,&#8221; which I had adopted for my scheme, should in
no way be misunderstood for conscription, but rather that
it should be looked upon simply as a personal responsibility
on the part of every youth to fit himself to take part in
the defence of his country, just in the same way as it was
his duty to attend school or submit to any other laws
governing his civil and economic life.</p>
<p>Kingston, with whom I had many conversations, was
a most keen supporter of the Universal Service system.
He agreed at once with the proposition as regarded the
amalgamation of the Volunteers with the partially paid
forces, and, what was more to the point, promised to find
the funds required. He was very anxious to introduce
and carry through Parliament, while he was Premier of
South Australia, a system of National Service, which, he
foresaw, would sooner or later find its way into the statutes
of Federated Australia. Even so early as this Kingston
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
was paving the way for a united Australia. He was at
that time considered, notwithstanding his personal foibles,
one of the ablest of the Australian Premiers.</p>
<p>He gave me instructions, confidentially, to draft two
Bills, one embodying the provision for the adoption of the
universal service, the other simply dealing with the proposed
changes in organization. When the time arrived to
place the proposals before Parliament Kingston had come
to the conclusion that the expenditure involved in initiating
National Service was greater than he could ask Parliament
to vote at the time. He determined, therefore, to pigeon-hole
it. The Re-organization Bill was promptly carried
by both Houses and became law. The Act of Parliament
fixed a date for the carrying out of the change. To avoid
the clerical work involved by the carrying out of the re-attesting
of the whole of the citizen forces, partially paid and
Volunteer, under the new Act it was provided that every
officer, non-commissioned officer and man who did not, in
writing, notify his intention to sever his connexion with
the forces owing to the new conditions, would continue
in the service, and the date for the beginning of his period
of service under the new Act, namely, three years, would
be entered in his existing attestation papers by the
respective commanding officers. If I remember rightly,
not one and a half per cent. withdrew.</p>
<p>The eventful day arrived on which every member of
the force ceased to be a soldier. The next day all willing
to do so would be soldiers again. That night we were
dining at Government House. After dinner it happened
to strike the Governor that there were no soldiers in South
Australia that evening with the exception of myself. So
lifting up his glass he said, &#8220;Behold our army! Every
soldier except one has been disbanded to-day. He is our
army. Good luck to him.&#8221; And &#8220;The Army&#8221; I became
to all my friends in Adelaide, and, later on, right
throughout Australia.</p>
<p>Jubilee Year, 1897, was now close at hand. I had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
steadily at work since my trip home in 1889, and was now
finishing my fifth year as Commandant. Everything was
working smoothly, and I was asked by Kingston if I would
like to take a trip home and attend officially the Jubilee
celebrations in London. I talked it over with my wife.
Our two children were then just four and three years old.
My wife thought that it would be more enjoyable for her
and for the children if we let alone the Jubilee festivities
and got six months&#8217; leave, reaching London later on in the
early summer, so that we could enjoy the autumn in
Scotland and return to Australia at the end of the year.
Kingston fell in with this suggestion, and I was granted
six months&#8217; leave of absence and reappointed Commandant
for a further period of five years.</p>
<p>We sailed in the <i>Damascus</i>, myself and wife, little
Eileen and Carlos, my youngest sister-in-law, Geraldine,
and my wife&#8217;s companion, Miss Ryan, who was specially
in charge of the children. The <i>Damascus</i>, an Aberdeen
liner, was a comfortable boat; she had been a short time
before fitted up to take Sir Henry Loch to South Africa.
We had chosen the Cape route to avoid the Red Sea in
the very hot weather. We spent a couple of days at
Durban and another two at Capetown, and reached London
about the middle of September. My mother and father
had both passed away, and the family properties had gone
to my nephew, Rafael, who was living in Spain. Wardhouse
and Kildrummy Castle were let. My sister, Magda,
Mrs. Lumsden of Clova, which marches with Kildrummy,
had asked us to stay with her. Our plans were to go to
Clova on our arrival in London, put in a couple of months
shooting, visit our old friends, then move up to London,
where my wife and the others would stay while I went to
Egypt. There I hoped to see as much as the time at my
disposal would allow of Kitchener&#8217;s campaign along the
Nile.</p>
<p>All went well, and I left Clova for London, on my way
to Egypt. I arrived at Morley&#8217;s Hotel on a Saturday.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
Next afternoon I received an urgent telegram to return at
once, as my wife had been taken suddenly very ill. I took
the first train. The telegrams I received on the journey
north were very disquieting. The news on arriving at
Aberdeen made me lose all hope of seeing her alive again.
Providence was, however, kind. The crisis passed, and
the doctors assured me she would recover in time. My
plans, of course, had to be altered. I gave up my intended
visit to Egypt. My wife&#8217;s recovery was very slow. We
had to make our journey south in stages.</p>
<p>One of our stopping-places was Newcastle-on-Tyne.
An amusing incident happened there. Both my wife and
myself had met in Australia that charming and graceful
actress, Grace Palotta. On our arrival at the hotel on a
cold, dark, winter&#8217;s afternoon, I left my wife in a sitting-room
and went off to attend to the rest of the family. On
my return she said, &#8220;Who do you think came in just
now? Grace Palotta. She is looking as pretty as ever.
She quite astonished me by telling me she is staying here
with her friend, the prince. Do try and find out who he
is. It is quite exciting.&#8221; I thought surely there was
some mistake, and told her so. &#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that is
just what she said. Do go to the theatre to-night, find
out and let me know all about it.&#8221; So, after an early
dinner, I went off to the theatre. As I arrived there, I
noticed the big posters announcing the name of the play.
The name of the play was <i>My Friend the Prince</i>. After
the performance Grace had some supper with us and a
real hearty laugh when we told her, and, in her pretty
foreign way, said: &#8220;Oh, I am afraid, Mrs. Gordon, you
thought I was a very naughty girl.&#8221; We met Palotta
afterwards in Australia, where she had often told this little
story to her friends, much to their amusement.</p>
<p>On arrival in London I took a house close to South
Kensington Station. As time passed it became evident
I would have to return to Australia alone. My wife&#8217;s
health still caused me grave anxiety. My leave being up,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
I was obliged to depart and leave the family to follow
me. I took my passage by the P. &amp; O. ss. <i>Himalaya</i>,
Captain Bruen, and left London at the end of 1899,
once again bound for Australia and returning to my
old command in Adelaide. This was my third voyage
to the other end of the world. It was, as usual,
full of pleasant memories. Once again I was elected
president of the sports and amusement committee. With
a good ship, a good captain, a full passenger list, the
hearty co-operation of all, and right good weather, it was
almost a record passage for comfort and enjoyment. Up
to schedule time we arrived at Albany in Western
Australia.</p>
<p>I went ashore to call upon some of my old friends,
bought an evening paper, and went into the club. Whilst
enjoying a pipe I glanced at one of the headings: &#8220;Death
of Colonel King-Harman, Military Adviser and Inspector
of Warlike Stores in London for the Australian Colonies.&#8221;
You may remember that he had been appointed as a result
of my visit home in 1889. He was an old Gunner friend
of mine, and I had seen a good deal of him before I left
London. Only the day before my departure he had
written me a note to say that he was sorry he had taken a
severe chill and would be unable to come and see me off
the next evening. Poor Harman never recovered from
that chill. It was something more serious that carried him
off in five weeks.</p>
<p>The possibility of my succeeding him temporarily
struck me. What a chance to return home to my sick
wife at once! It was the opportunity of a lifetime. A
convention of delegates from all the colonies was at the
time sitting in Melbourne. Every Premier was attending
the convention. I hastened to the post office and wired to
my old friend, Charles Cameron Kingston, still South
Australia&#8217;s Premier, notifying him of King-Harman&#8217;s
death, and asking him to arrange with the other Premiers
to postpone the appointment of King-Harman&#8217;s successor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
until the <i>Himalaya</i> reached Melbourne, requesting permission
at the same time to continue my journey in her to
Melbourne, instead of landing at Adelaide. Our steamer
sailed from Albany before I could receive an answer, so I
also asked him to wire to me at Adelaide. I felt somehow
that another streak of good fortune was coming my way.
Sure enough, on arrival at Adelaide, a telegram awaited me
from Kingston, instructing me to proceed to Melbourne.</p>
<p>On arrival at Melbourne I at once went to Parliament
House to see him, and told him of my wife&#8217;s severe illness,
which had compelled her to remain with the children in
England, and I asked him to assist me in getting Harman&#8217;s
appointment. He handed me a copy of my own report of
1890, recommending that an officer <i>on</i> the active list of
the Royal Artillery should hold the position, on which
recommendation the Premiers had acted. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;you are not on the &#8216;active list of the Royal
Artillery&#8217;; how can I possibly assist you?&#8221; I had had
plenty of time on the way from Albany to Melbourne to
think over this difficult point, which I had foreseen. I
had my answer ready. I suggested to him that I should
be appointed on loan, as it were, from Australia, for a
term of one year, during which time I should be granted
leave of absence from my appointment of Commandant of
South Australia, to which position I would return at the
end of the twelve months, and then an officer of the Royal
Artillery on the active list could be selected. It was a
big concession I was asking for, and I knew it. I said no
more. I knew my man. Kingston grasped a point
quicker than any man I have ever known, except perhaps
Kitchener. Both disliked superfluous words. Well,
Kingston just smiled and said: &#8220;Come and lunch with
me to-morrow. Good morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>At lunch next day there were four of us&mdash;Kingston,
Sir Edward Braddon, Premier of Tasmania, Sir John
Forrest, Premier of Western Australia, and your humble
servant. Both Sir Edward and Sir John were old friends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
of mine. After lunch Kingston asked me if I knew the
Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland
well. I told him I knew George Reid (New South Wales)
very well, but I knew nothing much about the Premiers
of Victoria or Queensland personally. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;see George Reid at once, tell him what you want and
the reason why, and let me know what he says about it.&#8221;
I saw George Reid during the afternoon, explained the
situation to him, and asked him for his support. He informed
me that he had already been approached on behalf
of another officer by some of his supporters, but had not
given a definite answer, and he felt that he could not very
well support me, who was in no way connected with New
South Wales. &#8220;You see,&#8221; he added, &#8220;there are six
colonies concerned. Now, have you got three Premiers
to support you?&#8221; I said &#8220;Yes.&#8221; (My three friends at
lunch.) &#8220;Well, then,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;if I remain neutral
and decline to vote you will have three votes to two in
your favour, and thus carry the day, even if the other
two vote against you.&#8221; With a hearty shake of his hand
and grateful feelings I left him. In the evening I reported
to Kingston the result of my interview with George Reid.
I felt I had succeeded as regarded the inspectorship of
stores. But what about retaining my appointment as
Commandant of South Australia while I was away? I
had just returned after an absence of six months. Was it
likely that the important position of Commandant was to
continue to be filled by a <i>locum tenens</i> for a further period
of one whole year? Kingston did not keep me long in
suspense. &#8220;Well done, Reid!&#8221; he said. &#8220;That settles
your going. I will see that you do not lose your appointment
of Commandant as long as I am Premier. Get
straight back to Adelaide and say absolutely nothing to
anyone. Act as if you were going to stay, but be ready to
get on a steamer homeward bound as soon as you hear from
me. Good-bye and good luck.&#8221; So we parted, and I found
my way back to Adelaide by the first coastal boat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>The day after my arrival there the mail steamer <i>Victoria</i>
was due to leave, homeward bound, at midnight. In the
afternoon of that day I got an official letter from the office
of the South Australian Premier notifying me that I had
been appointed Military Adviser and Inspector of Warlike
Stores for the Australian Colonies, Queensland being the
only objector. You can imagine the surprise my departure
caused, but I was away in the ss. <i>Victoria</i>, well into the
Australian Bight, making westwards, when the news of
my new appointment appeared in next day&#8217;s morning
papers. This was now my sixth voyage to and from
Australia, and was as pleasant as its predecessors.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>MILITARY ADVISER TO THE AUSTRALIAN COLONIES IN LONDON</h3>
</div>

<p>On my arrival in London I found that my wife was not
well. As a matter of fact, she was anything but well. I
at once removed her and the children to Richmond Hill
and set to work at my new duties. I was not prepared for
the consternation which my arrival in London caused
amongst the Agents-General of the Colonies which I was
to represent. Kingston had evidently thought it advisable
not to cable, with the result that the official notification
arrived by post practically at the same time as myself. Not
having any idea that their Governments in Australia intended
to send anyone home to fill the appointment, the
Agents-General had accepted the services of another Royal
Artillery officer on the Active List to carry on pending a
definite appointment being made, in accordance with the
conditions which had held when Colonel Harman was appointed.
This officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Baker, was as
much surprised as anybody when I arrived to take up the
duties which he naturally thought would devolve upon
himself. My position therefore was not a very pleasant
one, but I saw no reason why, with tact and care, the
unpleasantness should not be removed. I was right
in my forecast, and, before two months had passed,
my official relations with all concerned became quite
satisfactory.</p>
<p>There is no need, nor would it be of any special interest,
to enter into details of the many and varied duties which
appertained to the appointment. I had to buy anything,
from a submarine or destroyer to brass instruments for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
bands, and from the largest of guns to carbines and
bayonets and officers&#8217; whistles. The question of advising
the Government on making inquiries as to inventions was
not part of my duties, but yet hardly a week or a fortnight
passed that some persistent inventor did not find his way
into my offices. The question of getting new inventions
fully considered and tested by the War Office was always
a difficult one to those who did not know the ropes, and
there seemed to be a general idea amongst these clever
gentlemen that, if they could get some of the Colonies to
accept what they had to offer, it would be an easy road to
the War Office. During my time in London, however,
I must say that while several clever and very ingenious
devices were brought to me, none proved good enough to
enable me to recommend their adoption.</p>
<p>It had been decreed by the War Office that man&oelig;uvres
on a much larger scale than had as yet been held in
England should take place during the summer, and I
looked forward with a great deal of interest to being
present thereat. There appeared to be three principal
objects in carrying them out, to give senior officers an
opportunity of handling large bodies of men actually in
the field; secondly, to test the departmental services; and
thirdly, to test the possibilities and reliability of a system
of hired transport.</p>
<p>The invited visiting officers were quartered at the
Counties Hotel, Salisbury. Its situation was fairly convenient
and it was quite a comfortable hotel. There were
to be two armies, the Northern and the Southern, the two
together numbering somewhere between 80,000 and
100,000 men and commanded respectively by the Duke of
Connaught and General Sir Redvers Buller. The period
of man&oelig;uvres lasted some eight days. Salisbury Plain
and the surrounding country was the headquarters of the
Northern Army, while the Southern Army was camped
beyond the Downs to the south-west.</p>
<p>From the very start of the concentration of the troops
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
the weather promised to be of a very trying character.
The sun shone with almost tropical force. The large
bodies of troops, moving through the narrow roadways
and lanes, hemmed in by the high hedges, churned up
clouds of dust. Moving in the rear of the troops thousands
of wagons of the hired transport made matters worse. I
doubt if ever a more extraordinary collection of vehicles
and beasts of burden was ever got together anywhere in
the world. Big furniture vans, drawn by four or three
wretched-looking horses, would be seen just in front of
two-wheeled carts drawn by a couple of powerful Clydesdales.
The majority of the drivers, being civilians, did
much as they pleased. Once a section of the transport was
committed to a long piece of road or narrow lane without
cross-roads it simply had to go on; it couldn&#8217;t turn round;
it trusted to Providence to reach its destination. I think
it was the third or fourth day that the task set to the
armies was the occupation of a long ridge of the
Downs, some eight or ten miles south-west from
Salisbury.</p>
<p>Operations were to begin at six in the morning and
cease at two p.m., and the visiting officers were attached
that day to the Northern Army. The starting points of
the two armies were at about equal distances from the
objective. The point at issue was&mdash;who was to occupy
the long ridge position first? It was frightfully hot; I
have never known it hotter in England. I was glad of
my Australian hat and light khaki uniform as I rode along
the ranks of the sweltering infantry; the Scotch in their
small glengarrys, the artillery with their old-fashioned
forage caps, all were smothered in dust.</p>
<p>As the Northern Army advanced commanding officers
anxiously sought for news of the enemy. About half-past
twelve the visiting officers decided to ask permission to
push forward to the head of the advance guard and see
what was happening, for the hour to stop the battle was
getting close at hand and no enemy was in sight. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
pushed forward right to the slopes of the rising downs.
Still no signs of the enemy beyond a few small cavalry
patrols, which promptly retired before those of the
Northern Army. We were taken up to the crown of the
ridges.</p>
<p>On arrival there we could plainly see large bodies
of the enemy, evidently resting, and camping in some
beautifully wooded, shady country about three or four
miles away. Apparently something had gone wrong
somewhere. While the Northern Army marched some
nine or ten miles in that awful heat, their enemies had
probably not done more than three or four miles. But the
Northern Army had won the day. It had also been
arranged that&mdash;no matter which side did win the battle
that day, on the next morning the Northern Army was to
retire again, fighting a rear-guard action. Lord Wolseley
was by no means pleased with the day&#8217;s work. It was
reported that after listening at the usual pow-wow to what
the officer commanding the Southern Army, Buller,
had to say about the movements of his troops during
the day, he expressed his opinions in fairly forcible
terms.</p>
<p>Operations were to commence again at six o&#8217;clock the
next morning. A few captive balloons were being used
for observation purposes by both sides. It was presumed
that the Southern Army would take the opportunity, after
the comparative rest of the day before, of showing their
mettle, and a fairly ding-dong fight was expected. So
we were early in the field, back to the old ridge on the
Downs, where the battle had ceased the day before. We
were not disappointed.</p>
<p>I personally spent some unprofitable hours up in the air.
One of the captive balloons, in charge of an engineer officer,
was just being prepared ready to ascend when the officer,
whom I knew well, invited me to go up with him. I
handed my horse to the orderly and jumped into the basket,
and we were soon up some hundreds of feet in the air. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
was an interesting sight to see the southern force making
its way to the attack through the valleys between the
ridges. It was not pleasing to notice a half-squadron of
cavalry suddenly emerge from under cover of a farm near
by and charge straight for the wagon of our captive
balloon. I wondered what was going to happen. Could
the wagon get away out of reach in time? It didn&#8217;t seem
possible. My host had no intention of being captured;
he cut off the balloon from the wagon, which was duly
taken. The day turned out as hot as the day before.
There was hardly a breath of air and our balloon hung
poised over the enemy&#8217;s troops now passing under it. If
we came down we would, of course, fall into their hands
as prisoners. My host was determined not to be caught
and refused to come down. A couple of batteries of the
enemy&#8217;s artillery quite enjoyed themselves firing at us. I
suggested to him that, if it was real business, we were in
a very awkward position, but he didn&#8217;t mind. He thought
his balloon was good enough for anything except to go
down, and he didn&#8217;t intend to do that until the fighting
for the day was over, two o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. And
up in the air we stayed. As I had neither pipe nor tobacco
and we had nothing to eat or drink with us, I was not sorry
when we set foot on Mother Earth again. I think it was
that night, if not the next, a Saturday night, that we received
a message from the headquarters of the Duke
telling us of the defeat of the Khalifa at Omdurman by
the forces in Egypt under Kitchener. It was welcome
news.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the plight our War Office was in <i>re</i>
the supply of small arms ammunition at the beginning of
the South African War. Early in 1899 I received two
orders, large in their way, totalling some five million
rounds, for the .303 magazine rifle, from Sydney and Melbourne.
The rifle ammunition Mark V was then in use,
and very good ammunition it was too. The introduction
of Mark VI was under consideration, and there was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
probability of its replacing Mark V at an early date. I
had been watching with considerable interest the experiments
that had been taking place with the Mark VI, and
I was personally far from satisfied that it would be a
success. I decided to supply the order with Mark V, notwithstanding
my general instructions that all stores were to
be of the latest up-to-date pattern introduced into the
Service at home. As the first consignments of the Mark V
were shipped, I notified the Victorian and New South
Wales Governments of the steps I was taking. I did not
hear anything further in the matter for some two or three
months when, to my surprise, I received a cable from
Victoria, asking me upon what grounds I was sending out
Mark V ammunition and not Mark VI, which, they pointed
out, they understood had been adopted at home. At the
same time a member of one of the firms which were supplying
the ammunition called and informed me that his firm
had received an order direct from the Government of
Victoria for two million rounds of Mark VI ammunition,
requesting them to cease forwarding any more Mark V.
I immediately cabled to Victoria that I was not satisfied
with the Mark VI ammunition, that I expected it to be
withdrawn at an early date, and that, if they chose to
place orders direct with the contractors on their own, I
would accept no responsibility of any kind in the matter.
In the meantime, what was to be done with the still very
large balance of Mark V ammunition which was ready for
shipment? My friend, the member of the firm, was just
as aware as I was that Mark VI ammunition which they
had then begun to supply to the War Office was not by
any means likely to prove satisfactory. He actually
seemed rather pleased that the large balance of Mark V
was now practically left on his hands and would be replaced
by the Mark VI. As the inspection of the Mark VI
would naturally take some considerable time before it could
be passed and dispatched to Australia, there was no hurry,
as far as I could see, to communicate further by cable with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
Victoria. I may mention that the Government of New
South Wales had accepted the situation and were content
to receive their regular supplies of Mark V, having
accepted my suggestion.</p>
<p>Then my day came. The National Rifle Meeting was
held in Scotland. I voyaged up to watch for myself. It was
not long before serious complaints began to be made, not
only as regards the actual results of the shooting on the
targets, but, what was much more serious, the bursting of
two or three barrels and the blowing out of several breech-blocks.
I was quite satisfied and returned to London.
Courts of Inquiry were ordered by the Government, but,
what was more important, similar happenings occurred
later at the Bisley Meeting. The Council immediately
took up the matter with the Government. Result: Mark
VI ammunition condemned. Then went a cable to
Australia through the Press Association:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Mark VI ammunition condemned by Government.&mdash;The
information sent to the Colonies by the Inspector of
Warlike Stores confidentially has proved correct.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>Next day I received the following from Melbourne: &#8220;Is
the cable published here to-day with reference to Mark VI
ammunition true? If so, please rescind as soon as possible
the order for two million rounds placed with the contractors.&#8221;
There was nothing more to be done but to try
to induce the contractors to forgo their order for two
million Mark VI and let us have the Mark V. I think it
is to their credit to state that they at once met my wishes
in this respect, and an awkward situation was saved. This
happened only some two months before the declaration of
war against South Africa. The War Office, having
decided earlier in the year on the adoption of the Mark
VI, had placed very large orders with the contractors,
probably for some forty to fifty million rounds, and these
orders had been, to a large extent, executed, while, naturally,
the stocks of Mark V had been practically depleted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
The result was that the War Office found itself in the
critical position of entering upon a war with actually a
shortage of rifle ammunition. It will be remembered that
the Government of India came to the rescue.</p>
<p>I had now been in London over a year. The question
of my return had not been raised. Kingston was still
Premier, and my <i>locum tenens</i>, a Colonel Stuart, continued
acting for me as Commandant in South Australia.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>OFF TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR</h3>
</div>

<p>Towards the middle of September, 1899, rumours of war
began to spread. Early in October war was declared.
At that time a squadron of the New South Wales Lancers,
which had been sent home by voluntary subscription, was
undergoing a course of training in England under the
command of Captain Cox. The officers and men volunteered,
and they were the first Australian mounted troops
to land in South Africa.</p>
<p>I was naturally very anxious to go out myself, so I
cabled to the Governments of the several colonies for the
necessary leave. They refused, for the very good reason
that as war had been declared it was just the very time
when they required the services of their military adviser
in England. I could not quarrel with their decision. I
thought once more of my old friend, Charles Cameron
Kingston, cabled to him explaining the position, and suggested
that I should resign my appointment as Inspector
of Warlike Stores, return to my dormant appointment as
Commandant of South Australia, and on my arrival in
Adelaide obtain permission to proceed to South Africa as
a special service officer, if this could be arranged without
my having to give up the Commandantship. I felt fairly
certain of securing a position on the staff of the Commander-in-Chief
in connexion with the mounted contingents
of the Australian colonies, which were being so
freely offered by all of them to the Mother Country.
Kingston once again met my wishes. I cabled my
resignation to the Governments I was serving, and, being
fortunate enough to secure first-rate accommodation for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
the wife and family, set sail for Australia a few days after
war was declared, in the middle of October, in what was
then the finest passenger boat to Australia, the German
ship the ss. <i>Bremen</i>. And so began my seventh journey
across the world.</p>
<p>Our passage in the <i>Bremen</i> was as usual a fair weather
one, but it was fraught with much anxiety as regarded the
progress of the war. The ports of call of our ship were
Genoa, Port Said and Aden, Colombo, and then Western
Australia. As we arrived at each of these ports the news
from South Africa became graver and graver. Siege of
Ladysmith, siege of Mafeking, siege of Kimberley. Rebellion
in Cape Colony. Then Colenso and Spion Kop.
We felt somewhat relieved on arrival at Freemantle, where
the news met us that General Buller was to be superseded
in the command by Lord Roberts. On reaching Adelaide
I saw Kingston, my friendly Premier, and told him that
it was my intention, if he approved, to take my family on
to my wife&#8217;s relations in Melbourne, return at once to
Adelaide, raise the first mounted contingent, and sail with
it for South Africa. Once again Kingston fell in with
my views. I took the family to Melbourne and returned
to Adelaide.</p>
<p>The excitement throughout the Australian colonies at
that time, the middle of December, 1899, was intense.
Just previous to leaving England by the <i>Bremen</i> I had
been informed by the War Office, and by the Australian
Governments I then represented, that they had offered
contingents for service in South Africa to the Home
Government. I had called at the War Office and had been
told that the offer had been accepted, but that it had been
decided to accept infantry and not mounted units. I
pointed out to those in authority at the time that they had
quite failed to appreciate the temper of the offer of the
Australian colonies. The men who wished to volunteer
were not in the least anxious, in fact, they really had
the strongest objection, to walk about South Africa; they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
and their horses were one, and even if they couldn&#8217;t shoot
or be drilled in time to fulfil the conditions of a trained
cavalryman, at any rate they could ride like hell and shoot
straight.</p>
<p>The War Office people thought I was rather romancing.
I tried to disabuse them of this idea and ventured a step
farther. I said that I almost believed that the refusal of
the War Office to accept mounted troops might be taken
absolutely as an insult. I was told that they valued my
opinions and wished they had heard them before their
final decision had been cabled out, but it could not be
altered. The War Office had its way. The first contingent,
therefore, raised in the colonies were trained as
infantrymen, dispatched to South Africa, and on arrival
there were formed into one regiment, every member of
which was a first-class rider but a bad walker. They were
shifted about hither and thither, gained no particular
laurels, and rested not until the day came when they were
turned into a mounted regiment, shortly before the arrival
at Cape Town of the first mounted units. No more infantry
units were dispatched from the colonies. The War
Office had repented.</p>
<p>One of the reasons given to me for their preference for
infantry had been that it had been considered inadvisable
to put upon the Australians the extra expenditure that
would be incurred in equipping mounted corps. To say
the least of it, a very childish one.</p>
<p>I found on reaching Adelaide that there were enough
applications already handed in at the military staff office
to organize five or six squadrons, instead of one. It
became a question simply of selecting the best. Married
men were at once barred. Our unit was one squadron, a
hundred and twenty officers and men. The remark which
had been made to me in the War Office, previous to my
leaving London, with reference to putting the colonies
to extra expenditure in sending mounted troops, came back
to my mind. I called on my old friend, Mr. Barr Smith,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
and I suggested to him that it would be patriotic on his
part if he permitted me to notify to the Government that
he was willing to bear the expense of supplying some of
the horses required for the contingent. &#8220;Most certainly,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;You can tell the Government that they can
draw upon me for the amount required for the purchase of
the whole of the horses.&#8221; This was a winning card in my
hand. I called upon Kingston next morning and told him
of the offer. I further told him that I had already heard
whispers of probable opposition to my so soon relinquishing
my position as Commandant after my long absence
from Adelaide. &#8220;Don&#8217;t bother,&#8221; said Kingston. &#8220;You
are now going to fight for us; leave it to me. I am
announcing to the House this afternoon the Government&#8217;s
decision to send this first mounted contingent. You have
put in my hands a trump card&mdash;Mr. Barr Smith&#8217;s generous
offer. It will be received with the greatest enthusiasm
by the members. I shall tell them your part in it and
then immediately announce that I have selected you to
proceed at once to South Africa as a special service officer,
representing South Australia.&#8221;</p>
<p>It all happened that afternoon just as he had told me.
The House cheered and cheered as Mr. Barr Smith&#8217;s offer&mdash;following
on the notification to members that it was the
decision of the Government to send the mounted contingent&mdash;was
announced. Then followed the singing of &#8220;God
Save the Queen.&#8221; Before they had time to settle down
Kingston told them I had been selected as a special service
officer for duty in South Africa. More cheers. All was
well. My long absence was forgotten. All were glad to
see me back. All pleased that the opportunity was being
given me to go on active service. I was presented with
two splendid chargers, a bay and a blue roan, a sword,
revolver, binoculars, and enough knitted mufflers, Crimean
helmets, housewives and the like to last me a lifetime.
The only thing to be done was to select the men, purchase
the horses, and get ready to embark as soon as a transport
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
could be secured. Those selected were first-class riders
accustomed to the care of horses&mdash;most of them members
of the Mounted Rifles, and men who could shoot straight.
Within three or four weeks we should be on board the
transport, and could polish up a little their drill and
discipline during the voyage.</p>
<p>We arranged with the New South Wales and Western
Australian Governments for the ss. <i>Surrey</i> to convey our
three contingents to Cape Town. We totalled some three
hundred and eighty officers and men and four hundred
horses. One squadron from a New South Wales cavalry
regiment, one South Australian Mounted Rifles squadron,
and a similar one from Western Australia. The <i>Surrey</i>,
with the full complement on board, left Fremantle, in
Western Australia, in January, 1900. I can still shut my
eyes and see the immense crowds that wished us &#8220;God
speed,&#8221; and hear the continuous cheers of the people of
Adelaide on the day when we marched through the principal
streets of the city on our way to embarkation. It
was one of those events that one does not forget. Once
more I was on my way across the seas to the other side
of the world. My eighth voyage.</p>
<p>Fine weather across the Indian Ocean. I was not in
charge of the troops on board the ship. I was merely a
passenger, as a special service officer. Lieut.-Colonel
Parrott, a New South Wales engineer officer, was in
command. I had particularly arranged for this, as I had
heard of the difficulties that had arisen in connexion with
the transport of the first infantry units, and had considered
it more advisable to act as a sort of support to the officer
commanding than to be actually in command myself.
This plan turned out quite successful.</p>
<p>A finer lot of sports I shall probably never travel with
again. Among them we had men of all classes&mdash;judges&#8217;
sons, doctors&#8217; sons, squatters&#8217; sons, bootmakers&#8217; sons,
butchers&#8217; sons, all happy together, and all more than ready
for their job. Amongst our South Australian lot was one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
Jack Morant. He was not an Australian born, but had
come out from the old country a few years before, and
had an uncle at a place called Renmark, up the River
Murray, where the Chaffey brothers, the irrigation experts
from California, had established a fruit colony and had
induced several retired officers from the old country to
settle. Amongst these was Lieut.-Colonel Morant, Jack&#8217;s
uncle. The latter had been promoted to the rank of
corporal, and had been christened by his comrades &#8220;Corporal
Buller,&#8221; from the somewhat extraordinary likeness
he bore to General Sir Redvers. I will tell you more about
Jack Morant and his unfortunate end later on. Those of
you who read the <i>Sydney Bulletin</i> in the days before the
South African War may remember several typical Australian
poems that appeared in that clever journal over the
name of &#8220;The Breaker.&#8221; &#8220;The Breaker&#8221; was Jack
Morant.

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>WITH LORD ROBERTS IN SOUTH AFRICA</h3>
</div>

<p>It was on February 25, 1900, that the <i>Surrey</i> anchored in
Cape Town Bay. As soon as the usual formalities were
completed I was taken off in a special launch, and on
landing proceeded to report myself to General Forestier
Walker, at the time G.O.C. Lines of Communication.</p>
<p>Lord Roberts, who had superseded General Sir
Redvers Buller as Commander-in-Chief, was, I think, at
that very date hammering Cronje at Paardeberg. On the
voyage over in the <i>Surrey</i> I had prepared a scheme to
submit to Lord Roberts for the organization and employment
of the numerous mounted contingents that had been
offered by Australia and New Zealand. We little thought
then that over 16,000 officers and men and horses would
land in South Africa from Australia alone before the end
of the war. General Forestier Walker, after talking over
with me the details of the scheme, thought that it would
fit in with Lord Roberts&#8217; future plans, as confidentially
known to him, and he at once telegraphed to the Commander-in-Chief,
notifying him of my arrival, as well as
of the fact that I had an important proposition to put
before him. We were not long awaiting the answer. It
came that evening. It was short and to the point: &#8220;Chief
will gladly see Colonel Gordon at Bloemfontein as soon
as railway opens.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few days afterwards a further telegram arrived to
the following effect: &#8220;Colonel Gordon will proceed to
Naauport as soon as possible en route for Bloemfontein.
Four horses for the above-named officer and two grooms
to be sent on after him the very first opportunity.&#8221; I at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
once left Capetown and, passing through Naauport,
reached Norval&#8217;s Pont, where the railway crossed from the
Cape Colony to the Orange Free State. A really magnificent
railway bridge had been completed a few years before,
but just previous to my arrival the Boers, retreating northwards
across the river, had blown up the fine piers supporting
the two centre spans. The bridge was useless.
However, the South African Railway Pioneer Corps had
with extraordinary rapidity thrown a pontoon bridge across
the river.</p>
<p>Though Lord Roberts had by this time taken Bloemfontein,
having marched across and fought his way from
the west at Paardeberg to the east at Bloemfontein, the
southern portion of the Orange River State from the
bridge-head at Norval&#8217;s Pont to Bloemfontein was still in
the hands of the Boers, and it was through this country
that the railway line made its way northwards to Bloemfontein.
On my arrival at Norval&#8217;s Pont the railway
officer in charge informed me that I would have to wait
until a train came to the other side of the river from Bloemfontein.
I had to wait two days only. In the meantime,
Lord Kitchener, accompanied by the general manager of
the Bank of South Africa at Capetown, reached Norval&#8217;s
Pont, and crossed the river. A fourth passenger turned
up. It was Rudyard Kipling, if I remember rightly.</p>
<p>The journey to Bloemfontein did not occupy many
hours. We arrived in the evening, just before dark. I
made my way to one of the hotels. Curiously enough,
somehow, I caught sight of a flagstaff over the hotel. It
had a flag on it but it was evidently tied down to the pole.
After arranging for my room at the hotel I got on to the
roof to see what the flag was, and found it to be an Orange
River Colony flag, which had evidently been overlooked
by the authorities. I took possession of it.</p>
<p>Next morning I reported myself at headquarters. In
the train journey from Norval&#8217;s Pont I had had an opportunity
of describing my proposition to Lord Kitchener and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
talking it over with him. As a result, when by appointment
I saw Lord Roberts, he had had the matter put before
him and had agreed to its being carried out, with a few
alterations as regards detail. The chief points of the
scheme were as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1). That it was desirable to concentrate the strongest
possible force of mounted men then available in South
Africa at Bloemfontein.</p>
<p>(2). That all further arrivals of mounted units from
over the seas, or raised locally in South Africa, should
be sent on to Bloemfontein without delay.</p>
<p>(3). That these units should be equipped as mounted
infantry&mdash;that is to say, that their chief arm should be
the service rifle.</p>
<p>(4). That to each corps formed a strong unit of Imperial
Mounted Infantry should be attached.</p>
<p>(5). That these corps should be of sufficient numerical
strength to act as independent columns if desired.</p>
<p>(6). That whatever might be the strength of the contribution
of any individual Dominion or Colony, it would
form one unit, under the command of its own senior
officer.</p>
<p>(7). That, in grouping together the units of the
Colonies, care should be exercised in their selection, so as
to avoid any possible likelihood of friction.</p>
<p>(8). That the officers selected to the commands should
be the most experienced in mounted infantry work, and
young enough.</p>
<p>(9). That a special staff officer should be appointed to
organize the proposed mounted corps.</p>
<p>(10). That such a staff officer should be charged with
the provision and maintenance of the horses required and
deal directly with the officers in charge of remount depots.</p>
<p>(11). That such staff officer should be entrusted with
the responsibility of maintaining the units in an efficient
state as regarded arms, equipment, saddlery and clothing,
and that, in order to successfully carry out these duties,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
he should be permitted to draw all supplies necessary in
bulk direct from the Ordnance Depots at Capetown.</p>
<p>(12). That, in order to carry out this last suggestion as
to supplies, etc., the staff officer in question should have
authority to arrange with the General Officer Commanding
the main Line of Communications for such train services
as might be required and establish his own depôts
wherever necessary, and detail the personnel for the
efficient service thereof.</p>
<p>Lord Kitchener recommended the propositions. Lord
Roberts gave them his approval and requested me to see
him again on the next day, when he desired me to submit
to him in writing all details of the proposed organization
for his future consideration. In the meantime it was
necessary to find some suitable premises to be the headquarter
offices of the new corps. In the afternoon I looked
round Bloemfontein and was fortunate to secure quite a
large residence belonging to a near relation of President
Steyn.</p>
<p>In preparing the tables of personnel as desired by the
Commander-in-Chief, I restricted myself to the contingents
that had already arrived and those on their way from the
Australian Colonies. Next day I submitted the details I
had worked out. They were approved, and I was asked
if I had sufficient knowledge of the units already in South
Africa and those expected to arrive from Canada and New
Zealand. If so they were to be included in the scheme.
I had not any particular difficulty in carrying out Lord
Roberts&#8217; wishes in this respect as, during my few days&#8217;
stay in Capetown, while I was waiting to proceed to
Bloemfontein, I had asked for and had been supplied with
that very information by General Forestier Walker&#8217;s staff
officers.</p>
<p>There were sufficient companies of the Imperial
Mounted Infantry scattered about in the country to form
four regiments of four companies each. So that, by forming
four separate corps, a regiment of Imperial troops was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
available for each. In working out the distribution of the
Overseas Contingents it was found that by allotting (<i>a</i>)
to the First Corps the whole of the Canadians; (<i>b</i>) to the
second the New South Wales and Western Australian
contingents; (<i>c</i>) to the third the Victorian, South Australian
and Tasmanian contingents, and (<i>d</i>) to the fourth the
Queenslanders and New Zealanders, each corps would
number some fifteen hundred officers and men without the
departmental troops attached.</p>
<p>The above distribution was approved. I was then
appointed Chief Staff Officer for Overseas Colonials
on Lord Roberts&#8217; Staff, and ordered to assemble all
the units concerned and organize them at Bloemfontein
with as little delay as possible into corps as above.
Distinguished mounted infantry officers were selected
to command the four corps which were to be known
as a brigade, namely, Alderson, Henry, Pilcher and
De Lisle. Shortly afterwards orders were issued for a
similar organization to be carried out in the case of the
mounted units raised in South Africa to be likewise called
a brigade, the two brigades forming a division. General
Hutton was selected for the command of the Overseas
Brigade, General Ridley for the South African, and
General Ian Hamilton for Divisional Commander.</p>
<p>Quite three-fourths of the proposed strength of the
Overseas Brigade was encamped on the lower slopes of
Signal Hill within four weeks of my receiving my instructions.</p>
<p>By May 7 I had established my depôts at Capetown and
Bloemfontein and had succeeded in re-equipping our
brigade as well as obtaining the greater portion of the
horses required. The remainder were arriving in batches
each day, and I had accumulated sufficient stores of all
kinds to attend to their wants on arrival.</p>
<p>Hutton arrived and took command of his brigade; a
real fine lot of men they were, too. The horses were good
and in fine fettle. When on parade it was quite difficult
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
to differentiate between the four corps. They were an
equally strong, hardy lot of men, clear-eyed, sitting their
horses as only the Colonials can.</p>
<p>I had known Hutton well, as you know, during his
period of command in New South Wales. After leaving
New South Wales he had put in three years as General
Officer Commanding in Canada. If there was one branch
of the Service which he dearly loved, it was the mounted
rifles. I don&#8217;t remember any general ever looking so
happy and contented as he did on the day he took command,
and I was not surprised. I was proud enough of
them myself. What valuable work they did afterwards in
the field was fully appreciated by the Commander-in-Chief
and the other troops alongside of whom they fought during
the campaign.</p>
<p>During our stay at Bloemfontein I had several opportunities
of discussing with Lord Roberts and Kitchener
the scheme for universal service which I had years before
prepared at Adelaide. They were both very keenly interested
in it, and we talked it over from every point of view.
Lord Roberts considered it eminently suitable and most
desirable, especially when remembering the deep-rooted
objection that existed to military conscription at home and
in the Colonies.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>IN COMMAND OF A MOUNTED COLUMN</h3>
</div>

<p>On the day before he left Bloemfontein Lord Roberts sent
for me and asked me how many of the Overseas Brigade
had been unable to march out of Bloemfontein. I informed
him that taking into account the sick and convalescent,
two or three units which had only just arrived,
and some for whom I was awaiting delivery of horses from
the Remount Depôt, in all somewhere between seven and
eight hundred men. He also asked me to ascertain as
soon as possible how many had been left behind belonging
to General Ridley&#8217;s brigade. I did so, and found that
they had left behind somewhere about a thousand. He
said: &#8220;Very well. I now want you to put all those details
together, organize them into a mounted column, equip
them, and get the requisite number of horses within a week
or ten days if practicable. I have given instructions that
your wants are to be attended to by all the parties concerned
as early as possible. You will then leave Bloemfontein;
the column will march, passing to the westward
of Karee Siding, to Brandfort. Then, with a wide sweep
to the westward, returning to the railway line at Small
Deel. You will receive further orders at Small Deel as to
what route to take from that place to Kroonstad. I shall
be looking for your arrival, if all goes well with you, and
I am counting upon your arriving with between twelve
and fifteen hundred horses, in good condition, to replace
the losses in horseflesh amongst the mounted troops in
my advance. I fully anticipate that as we drive the Boers
northwards on our broad front&mdash;the centre of which will
be practically the main railway line&mdash;numbers of them will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
break away to our flanks, clear them, and then close in
backwards in our rear to attack our lines of communications.
I don&#8217;t think that they&#8217;ll be expecting any mounted
columns of any strength to be following up behind. So
that you have got to watch for them and deal them a nasty
blow if you come across them.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you understand. Your two special duties are:
first, to watch the lines of communications, and secondly,
so to nurse your horses that they may arrive as fit as
possible. By the by, I don&#8217;t think I have told you that
I have appointed you to command the column. I don&#8217;t
think it will interfere with your other duties, as I know
you&#8217;ve got them well in hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thanked him, but I pointed out that my greatest
difficulty in equipping the brigade had undoubtedly been
to obtain suitable transport. I very much doubted if, after
the general advance from Bloemfontein, there remained a
single decent wagon or cart behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I know that. You must travel as
light as you can. Make use of the railway line as much as
possible, and collar whatever vehicles you can get. Good
luck! I&#8217;ll see you at Kroonstad.&#8221;</p>
<p>My column altogether numbered about seventeen hundred.
The night we arrived at Brandfort the officer
commanding was glad to see us. He was expecting a
surprise attack that night, but nothing happened. No
doubt the news of our arrival had reached the Boers and
they had thought better of it. On our sweep from Brandfort
to Small Deel we met a good many small parties of
Boers as we went through the ranges, but they gave us no
trouble except a lot of sniping. We got a good many
surrenders, and arrived at Small Deel hale and hearty.
There I received my orders to march on to Welgelegen
and thence to Kroonstad, watching the country to the left
of the railway line. As we were camped at Welgelegen
two nights afterwards I received a message from Lord
Kitchener to the effect that it had been reported that some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
five hundred Boers and four guns had been seen moving
in the direction of Welgelegen and that I was to do my
best to intercept them, and, in any case, in moving on to
Kroonstad to proceed on both sides of the railway line
on as broad a front as the numbers at my disposal would
allow. We could hear nothing of the five hundred Boers
and four guns, so after a thorough search of the country
round Welgelegen we marched on to Kroonstad.</p>
<p>On arriving there I reported at headquarters. Lord
Roberts informed me that he would inspect the column
next morning at 10 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>A.M.</span> The Commander-in-Chief
arrived up to time. His inspection was a very short one,
his chief anxiety being the condition of the horses. Fortunately
they were in good fettle, and their condition met
with his approval. He thanked me and gave instructions
to his staff officers for the future disposition of the several
units.</p>
<p>Before 4 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>P.M.</span> that afternoon the bivouac ground was
empty and my composite column dispersed. I at once set
to work to gather up the threads of my own especial work.
The first thing was to establish a depôt at Kroonstad for
my brigade supplies. The next, to bespeak horses at the
Remount Depôt, just established at Kroonstad. I was
busy at this work the next day when I received a message
to report myself at headquarters. On arrival there General
Grierson, the Quartermaster-General, told me that he
wanted me to take up a special job at once. He added that
the arrival of my horses in good condition had enabled
the Commander-in-Chief to move on, and that he had
decided to advance to Pretoria straight away. It had been
anticipated that there would not be any great opposition
on the part of the Boers, at any rate as far as the Vaal
River. The advance would be a very rapid one,
especially on the part of the mounted troops forming
the two enveloping wings on both sides of the railway
line.</p>
<p>It was therefore necessary that the transport for their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
supplies should not fail during their advance. It had been
arranged that General French&#8217;s cavalry, with Hutton&#8217;s
mounted riflemen, should advance to the westward of the
railway, and that he wanted me to take charge of their
combined transport and supply columns. I told Grierson
that I was doubtful whether I had enough experience for
that sort of work. Didn&#8217;t he think that someone better
fitted should be selected? Grierson told me that Lord
Roberts had suggested my name, and that he thought
that was quite enough. There was nothing more to be
said.</p>
<p>I asked for instructions. He said &#8220;Go and see Ward
and you will get them.&#8221; I went across to Colonel Ward,
at the D.A.Q.M.G.&#8217;s quarters, and saw him. He told
me that the troops were advancing early next morning,
that General French&#8217;s supply column was last heard of
as about to leave Welgelegen, and he had no intimation
of any kind as to Hutton&#8217;s supply column.</p>
<p>The situation, then, was shortly this. The two
mounted brigades were leaving early in the morning of
the 22nd, and expected to advance during the day somewhere
between twenty and thirty miles. One of the two
supply columns was timed to reach Kroonstad, the starting
point of the two troops, on the evening of the day of
the departure of the brigades, and required a rest, and there
was no information available as to the whereabouts of the
second supply column. The outlook was not cheerful.
Having gathered a small staff I dispatched a party to hunt
up Hutton&#8217;s column, with orders that they were to be
hustled up to Kroonstad without delay.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the day making the necessary
arrangements for the provision of escorts for the columns,
which, owing to the existing circumstances, would be
unable to move on together. It was quite evident that
French&#8217;s column would have to leave Kroonstad before
Hutton&#8217;s, and that owing to the rapid advance of the
troops in front it would be impossible for the two supply
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
columns to join up en route. The only practical solution
that came to my mind was to hurry on French&#8217;s column,
feed Hutton from it, and trust to be able to push forward
Hutton&#8217;s column, when I got hold of it, in time to
make up French&#8217;s deficiencies before he actually fell
short.</p>
<p>Knowing that the supplies of a commanding officer in
the field are always looked upon as actually his own
property, I deemed it most advisable to obtain a written
order from headquarters to carry out this plan, if necessary.
I saw Colonel Ward, and he was good enough to
give me a written order to that effect. This relieved my
mind. As a matter of fact, when we picked up the
mounted brigades it did become necessary for me to
supply Hutton from French&#8217;s supply column. Lieut.-Colonel
Johnson, an artillery officer, who was in command
of this column, protested most strongly against parting
with any of his supplies, but, on my handing him a copy
of the D.A.Q.M.G.&#8217;s order to me, he, of course, complied.
But I knew right well what to expect next morning. I
was not disappointed. I had camped down that night
between French&#8217;s and Hutton&#8217;s Brigades. Up to that I
had had no news of the whereabouts of Hutton&#8217;s supply
column, but I knew that French would send for me very
early in the morning. About four in the morning I got
news of Hutton&#8217;s column. It had reached Kroonstad
from Welgelegen the evening before, and would move on
as per orders.</p>
<p>I need not say that it was a great relief, as it enabled
me to look forward to my forthcoming interview with
French with less concern. Just at daylight I saw a couple
of lancer troopers galloping along towards my little camp.
I rode out to meet them. I knew what they wanted.
They told me they came from General French, who wished
to see the officer who had borrowed his supplies the evening
before. Could I tell him where they would find him?
I told them it was all right, that I was the officer they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
wanted, and they could lead the way. I shall not forget
that morning. We were in the vicinity of a place called
Essenbosch. It was a typical South African fine weather
morning. The frost was on the ground. The sun was
just rising, but not a cloud in the sky. A big plain. Not
a tree; all clear veldt for miles. The two brigades were
on the move. It was as pretty a sight as any soldier could
wish to see.</p>
<p>After three or four miles&#8217; ride I reached General
French and his staff. Our conversation was brief but to
the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you the officer by whose orders supplies were
taken from my column last evening?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, sir.&#8221; And, pulling out my pocket-book, I produced
Colonel Ward&#8217;s written order.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just understand that I allow nobody to borrow or
take my supplies in the field. If my troops go one hour
short of supplies you will hear from me again. Good
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, sir,&#8221; I said, and rode back to my
camp.</p>
<p>I had noticed a staff officer looking hard at me under
his helmet. I suddenly recognized him. It was my old
school chum at the Oratory, Edmund Talbot, the Duke of
Norfolk&#8217;s brother. I had not seen him since I had left
school. We were glad to meet again. The world is
small. Then off they went, and I was left behind to work
out my problem.</p>
<p>At the time Hutton&#8217;s column was some forty miles in
the rear. I had two days&#8217; more supplies left in French&#8217;s
column. The question was whether I would succeed in
hurrying up Hutton&#8217;s column sufficiently fast in four days
to pick up the advancing troops.</p>
<p>I had information from headquarters that Lord Roberts
intended to get at any rate some of his troops across the
River Vaal from the Orange Free State into the Transvaal
on May 24, Queen Victoria&#8217;s birthday, as he particularly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
wished to cable to her, on that day, the news of the complete
occupation of the Orange Free State and the entry
of his troops into the Transvaal. This meant an advance
at the rate of some twenty-five miles a day on the part of
French&#8217;s and Hutton&#8217;s brigades. Fortunately Hutton&#8217;s
column was enabled, but, indeed, at very heavy loss in
oxen and mules, to reach French&#8217;s as it emptied its last
wagon.</p>
<p>By selecting the fittest of the draught animals left belonging
to the emptied column, and the fittest of those in
Hutton&#8217;s column, we were able to push on, and, four days
afterwards, on the evening of May 24, when a few cavalry
actually did cross the River Vaal, at a place called Parisj
to the westward of the railway line, the last two days&#8217;
rations reached French&#8217;s brigade headquarters half an hour
before scheduled time. The job was over. I should be
sorry to say how many animals were left on the road and
how long it took the empty wagons, of which there were
some eight hundred, to return to the base with their sorely
depleted teams. For the previous four days and nights I
just rested and slept when and where I could, sometimes
for an hour, sometimes for two or three, but you may
imagine what a good night&#8217;s rest myself and my much
harried and worried staff enjoyed that night after drinking
the toast of the day, &#8220;God bless our Queen.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t
think it necessary to go and see General French again.</p>
<p>Next morning I started across country towards
Vereeniken, the border station of the Transvaal. I
reached there in safety, though I had to cross a portion of
the country in advance of our own troops. I reported
myself at headquarters, saw Grierson and asked him, as
a special favour, not to give me the charge of any more
supply columns in the near future. He was kind enough
to give me a short note from Lord Roberts, personally
thanking me for the good result of the two special jobs he
entrusted to my care from the time he had left
Bloemfontein.</p>

<p>After the Battle of Belfast, about August 25, the
organization of the brigade was practically broken up, and
there was no further necessity for the special post to which
I had been appointed as Chief of the Staff for Overseas
Colonials. On Lord Roberts&#8217; departure for England I

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>SOME SOUTH AFRICAN REMINISCENCES</h3>
</div>

<p>I never enjoyed better health than I did during the twelve
months when the hard veldt was my bed and the deep,
dark, starry night was the roof over my head. No one
can wish for a more healthy climate than that of the
Orange River Colony during the dry season. I was only
twice hit; once near Karree Siding when a pom-pom shell
burst just under my horse and took off the heel of one of
my boots; the second time a sniper&#8217;s bullet went through
my coat sleeve without touching me. But I was unfortunate
otherwise. One night I was riding along the veldt
on a horse which had been presented to me when I left
Adelaide by a friend of mine, one of the best horsemen
in South Australia, Stephen Ralli, which we had christened
Bismarck. We suddenly came to the edge of a dry donga
with, of course, rotten sides. Down we had to go, and
down we went. For a moment I had no idea whether we
were being flung into a river or into a dry channel. It
happened to be a dry channel, some sixteen feet deep and
about the same width. We hit the bottom hard. I was
sent rolling off, Bismarck fell on his head and broke his
neck, turning over on his side. I picked myself up and
could find no bones broken, and I called out to some of
my men who had seen us disappear and had halted on
the edge. They were glad to hear me call out. The question
was then, how to get out of the donga. The banks
were steep. So, unhooking the horses out of one of the
Cape carts, they joined up the traces and I was safely
hauled up. I did not for some time afterwards really feel
any ill results from my fall. In fact I had forgotten all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
about it. But, later on, I found that I suffered a
good deal when riding and that I had received an
internal injury which afterwards caused me considerable
trouble.</p>
<p>I shall never forget the constant and uniform kindness
which I met at the hands of Lord Kitchener. Many and
very different opinions of Lord Kitchener&#8217;s capabilities as
a soldier and of his temperament as a man have been expressed.
I formed my own opinion in both capacities
from actual and continuous contact with him in his work.
He was a silent man. Talk was of no value to him when
it wasn&#8217;t to the point. He possessed a peculiar but very
useful gift of getting at the kernel of a subject, seizing
its meaning and promptly making up his mind what action
he was going to take. If he wanted any further information
on any point he asked you for it. If he didn&#8217;t want
it, he did not thank you for volunteering to give it. He
was a master of detail. He was forceful in his opinions&mdash;too
forceful for those who disagreed with him. He may
not have been too generous in giving open praise, but he
never forgot those who had done him good service. As
to whether he was a great general I have no opinion to
offer, but he could always be depended upon to carry out
whatever he took in hand.</p>
<p>During his trip to Tasmania, years later on, at the time
of his inspection of the Forces of the Australian Colonies,
a Light Horse Camp was being held at a place called
Mona Vale belonging to Major Eustace Cameron who
commanded the Light Horse. The homestead was a fine
modern house. Mrs. Cameron had arranged for a large
party of young people during the period of the camp.
Lord Kitchener was the guest of Cameron for the day and
night of his inspection. After dinner that evening a small
dance was held. Songs with choruses were sung between
the dances, and perhaps nobody enjoyed himself so much
as Lord Kitchener. Later on in the evening, or rather in
the early hours of the morning, he told us several good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
stories and much hearty laughter filled the smoking-room.
Lord Kitchener was no woman-hater.</p>
<p>War has not always a grave side. Interesting events,
and sometimes even amusing ones, intervene. Some of
them now come to my mind. In the early part of the war
Capetown had become overrun with men in officers&#8217; uniforms
and many ladies, most of whom were by way of
being attached to voluntary and other hospitals. Most of
these ladies were amateur, not qualified nurses. Mount
Nelson Hotel was their chief resort. While a very large
building it was unable to house the majority of them.
They were scattered about throughout the city in other
hotels and boarding-houses. Yet Mount Nelson was <i>the</i>
place where all met.</p>
<p>Each night the resources of the Mount Nelson were
strained. Dinner parties, music and dancing were the
order of the day. Tables had to be engaged for days
previously. A night arrived when the festivities were at
their height. Dinner had begun. The large dining-room
was full to overflowing, with the exception of one small
table set for two in the middle of the room. The <i>entreés</i>
were being served and the band had just finished a spirited
selection.</p>
<p>The babble of tongues was all over the room when in
walked two gentlemen in uniform, preceded by the manager
of the hotel, making their way to the empty table set for
two. The babble of tongues began to subside. The first
officer following the manager was a tall man with rather
a severe look in his eyes. It happened to be Lord
Kitchener, followed by his personal private secretary. For
a moment there came a dead silence, immediately relieved
by the strains of the band beginning an operatic overture
and the dinner proceeded. At the end of dinner all officers
in uniform were notified to interview a staff officer previous
to leaving the hotel. Within two days the number of
officers frequenting the Mount Nelson Hotel was reduced
to a minimum. A couple of days afterwards the manager
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
informed me that he had been instructed the night of the
fateful dinner to give notice to all officers in uniform then
staying at the hotel who could not produce a permit to
vacate their rooms. Steps were also taken to inquire into
the positions held by many of the amateur lady nurses, and
those whose services were deemed to be superfluous were
provided with return passages to Europe. Thus ended
this episode.</p>

</div>

<p>An amusing incident occurred at a place called Derdepoort,
some ten miles outside Pretoria, where one of our
columns, under General Hutton, was holding a section of
the defences of the capital. I had dispatched their supplies
of winter clothing to them, and it was decided to
issue them on a Sunday afternoon. Amongst the thousands
of cases that my depôts were handling were many
containing presents of tobacco, pipes, books, and so on, to
the men of the contingents. When the unpacking of those
that had arrived at Derdepoort had taken place on the
Sunday afternoon it was discovered that several very large
ones contained women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s garments of all
kinds and descriptions. The Tommies were not slow in
appreciating the situation. The sounds of hearty laughter
were soon ringing throughout the camp. I heard it in my
tent, where I was taking a quiet afternoon nap. I went
out to see what was happening. It was indeed a quaint
sight. An amateur fancy dress ball was being held, and
anything more comical it is difficult to imagine. The explanation
of the arrival of the costumes was soon made
clear. An association of ladies had been formed in New
Zealand with the object of supplying clothing for the Boer
women and children in the refugee camps that had been
established by us for them in South Africa. The cases
containing the clothing had been forwarded to Derdepoort
by mistake.</p>
<p>During Lord Roberts&#8217;s stay in Pretoria it was discovered
that a plot was set on foot to kidnap the Commander-in-Chief.
It was, however, nipped in the bud.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
One of the leaders was an officer of the Transvaal State
Permanent Artillery. The plot, of course, failed and the
officer was brought to trial and duly shot. Tommy enjoyed
his bit of fun over the attempt to kidnap Lord
Roberts. At that time Lady Roberts and her daughters
were at Pretoria, and the Tommies thought that it wouldn&#8217;t
be so bad if they kidnapped Lady Roberts, but they had
the strongest objection to losing Bobs.</p>
<p>Previous to the Battle of Diamond Hill a short armistice
was arranged for. The commanding officer of the Boers
opposed to us at the time was General Louis Botha. The
military situation then was a difficult one. Had it not
been that just then General De Wet, in the north-eastern
part of the Orange River Colony, had become suddenly
and successfully aggressive, it was probable that General
Botha would have come to terms. However, as the result
of De Wet&#8217;s action he decided to carry on. The interesting
point in the incident was the fact that General Botha&#8217;s
wife was selected as our emissary. Probably it was the
first time, and the last, that the wife of an enemy&#8217;s general
acted in such a capacity.</p>
<p>On our arrival in Pretoria the whole of the conditions
appertaining to the civil life of the town had to be reorganized.
Previous to its occupation by us Kruger had ordered
that all Boer families who had members serving in their
forces and who occupied leased houses could do so free of
rent, while men in business with relatives fighting could
occupy their leased premises at half the usual rents. This
disability on the part of the property owners to obtain their
rents was at once removed by Lord Roberts. In order to
give effect to this decision it was necessary to appoint
officials. Practically what was really required was a sort
of glorified bum-bailiff, with the necessary assistance, the
bum-bailiff holding a position similar to that of a magistrate.
I was asked to suggest the name of a senior officer
of the Australians who would be suitable. I did so. But
the point arose by what name was the appointment to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
designated? I don&#8217;t remember who was the happy
originator of the name, but it shortly appeared in General
Orders that Colonel Ricardo, of the Queensland Forces,
had been appointed &#8220;High Commissioner of Ejectments&#8221;
at Pretoria. Surely a name worthy of Gilbert and
Sullivan.</p>
<p>I was lunching one day at the Pretoria Club when
Bennet Burleigh, the well-known war correspondent, told
me that he had just lost the services of his dispatch rider
and asked me to recommend him a good daring rider and
first-class bushman to take his place. All through life I
have found that trifles often have serious consequences. I
just happened, on my way to the club, to have seen crossing
the square Morant, otherwise Corporal Buller, of the
South Australian Contingent. I had not seen him for
some considerable time. I bethought myself at once that
Morant would be just the man to fit the billet. If I had
not happened to see him I should certainly not have
thought of him and Morant&#8217;s career might have been a
very different one. I told Burleigh that Morant was a
gentleman, a good rider and bushman, and I didn&#8217;t think
he personally feared anything. Burleigh thanked me and
offered to take him at once. Next morning Morant
became his dispatch rider.</p>
<p>Occasionally, after this, during the advance to Koomatipoort,
Morant would turn up and pay me a visit. He
usually arrived with a bundle of any old newspapers he
could get, which he very gravely and without a smile
handed over to me, hoping that they would be very welcome.
But there was a look in his eye that I knew well.
&#8220;Have a whisky and soda, Morant?&#8221; I&#8217;d say. &#8220;Well,
sir, I don&#8217;t think it would be so bad. I would like one
very much.&#8221; He would then settle himself down comfortably,
light his pipe and start to tell me all sorts of bits of
news that had come his way. I often had but a few minutes
to give him and had to leave him in possession, telling
him to look after himself and be happy. Which he did.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>He was well pleased with his job, looked a typical war
correspondent himself, and was making good money. I
heard no more until, some months later, I received a note
from him from England telling me that he had been taking
a short holiday and was returning to South Africa. He
was joining a friend of his, Major Hunt, and they proposed
to raise an irregular corps on their arrival. The
corps was raised, the &#8220;Bushveldt Carabiniers.&#8221; This
corps had nothing whatever to do with Australia. Nor
could Morant himself lay any claim to being Australian.
The corps was raised from Colonials and British, chiefly
out of a job, then in South Africa. They appear to have
had somewhat of a free hand in the operations which
marked the latter portion of the campaign. Drives were
taking place. Units were scattered, and to a certain extent
had to be left to their own devices. The Bushveldt Carabiniers
occupied for some time a wild region called The
Splonken. While dealing with the Boers in that locality
Major Hunt had, so it was officially reported, been murdered
by the Boers, having been induced to approach a
farm house on which a white flag was flying. The story
goes that he was found lying dead on the stoep of the
farm and that his body had been mutilated. Morant
swore to avenge his friend&#8217;s untimely end&mdash;it was reported
that he had become engaged to Hunt&#8217;s sister during his
visit to England. He determined to give no quarter, and
several prisoners who fell into his hands were promptly
shot there and then. He and four other officers were,
later on, in January, 1902, court-martialled on the charge
of having personally committed or been accessory to the
murder of twelve Boers. The five were found guilty, in
different degrees. Handcock, Wilton and Morant were
sentenced to death, and Morant was shot at Pretoria.</p>
<p>I am in a position to give a short account of Morant&#8217;s
last hours. When crossing over in the ss. <i>Surrey</i> from
South Australia a man called John Morrow, who had been
my groom for a couple of years in Adelaide, had become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
a close friend of Morant&#8217;s. It was difficult to say why.
Practically the only thing they had in common was their
love for horseflesh. Morrow was quite an uneducated
man. Morant was the opposite. Still, friends they were.
When the Police Force for the protection of Pretoria
was raised the majority of the men selected came
from the Australians, and Morrow was one of them.
Later on he had been appointed one of the warders at the
jail. As bad fortune would have it, he was given charge
of Morant and was with him the evening before he was
shot. I had a long letter from Morrow, later on, enclosing
a photograph of the officers concerned, which had
been taken, evidently, about the time that the corps was
raised. On the back of it was written in pencil: &#8220;Dear
Jack. To-morrow morning I die. My love to my pals in
Australia.&mdash;Morant.&#8221; It was probable that these were the
last words that Morant wrote. Morant died as he had
lived. He faced his end bravely.

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>ORGANIZING THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA</h3>
</div>

<p>On my arrival at Adelaide I at last resumed my duties as
Commandant after three and a half years&#8217; absence. The
Government of South Australia did me the honour to
promote me to the rank of brigadier-general, and the
Governor informed me that I had received the Companionship
of the Order of the Bath for my services in South
Africa.</p>
<p>The Act to constitute the Commonwealth of Australia
received the Royal assent on June 10, 1900. The provisions
that had been considered in framing it had
received lengthy and most careful consideration on the
part of the colonies concerned. There had been no hurry
and no unnecessary speeding up. The history of each
of the colonies tells us that they had always worked on
constitutional lines, and that they had not been slow in
adopting measures which had proved of benefit and a
credit to those who first put them on the statute books.
No point that might create serious discussion, or mar the
initial success of the Commonwealth had been overlooked.
The ablest brains of all the colonies had worked in unison,
a great achievement in these days of selfishness and
personal greed.</p>
<p>Everything was in readiness. The elections for the
Commonwealth Parliament took place, and the first
Government was formed. Sir William Lyne was then
Premier of the Mother State. He was charged with the
formation of the first Ministry, but was not successful in
his task. The responsibility then fell upon the shoulders
of Sir Edmund Barton, who gathered round him what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
was at the time called &#8220;the Ministry of all the Talents.&#8221;
The Premier of practically every State was included.
Then came March 1, 1901, when the actual constitutional
functions of the Commonwealth started. For some time
previously, in fact even before the Act had received Royal
assent, the question who was to hold the all-important
appointment of Governor-General had been exercising the
public mind. In Australia itself there seemed to be
only one opinion. The Earl of Hopetoun was easily
favourite.</p>
<p>It may be safely said that no Governor of any of the
Australian colonies up to that time had so successfully
represented the Throne. Those who were in Melbourne
on his arrival when he became Governor of Victoria well
remember a man of somewhat light build, middle height,
pale, clean-shaven, youthful in appearance. A few
minutes&#8217; conversation with him satisfied one of his affable
ways and genial disposition. There was nothing hard in
his features, but the lines about the lower part of his face
would set firmly and resolutely when required, while his
eyes, when looking at you straight in the face, left no
doubt of his strength of character. A man of parts, a
keen sportsman and a reliable personal friend. From
the very first day of his arrival both his charming countess
and himself won the hearts of the people. One may
almost say that it was love at first sight, if this phrase can
be applied to popular feeling. The outward signs of the
approval spontaneously given to the appointment ripened
during his term of office into personal affection, which was
returned by both the holders of the high office, and became
deeper with each year of their stay in Melbourne. The
sister colonies were not slow in appreciating the good
opinion formed of him by the Victorians. Whenever he
visited the neighbouring Governors he received splendid
welcome. When his term of office expired and he returned
home he carried with him the good wishes of all.
It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that his appointment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
as the first Governor-General was looked upon as a
most desirable one.</p>
<p>The Government had decided that the Governor-General&#8217;s
first landing in Australia should be at the capital
of the Mother Colony, New South Wales, and it had been
arranged that the then flagship of the naval squadron in
Australia, the <i>Orlando</i>, should meet the mail steamer on
which Their Excellencies were travelling, at Adelaide, and
convey them to Sydney Harbour. I remember well the
morning the steamer arrived at Adelaide. We had heard
by cable from Western Australia that His Excellency was
anything but well, but we were not prepared to see him
looking so ill. It was with difficulty that he was transferred
to the <i>Orlando</i>, and we wondered whether he would
recover sufficiently to take his part in the arduous functions
ahead of him. However, though always somewhat on the
delicate side, he was full of grit and determination, and,
when the time came, he was able to fulfil all his obligations,
much to the delight of everybody.</p>
<p>Sydney had surpassed itself in the arrangements to
celebrate the unique occasion. I don&#8217;t remember ever
seeing decorations so profuse or in such good taste. The
whole of the principal streets were a mass of colour.
Venetian masts lined the pavements at short intervals.
Endless festoons of evergreens and flowers crossed overhead.
Balconies and windows were swathed in bunting
and flags; thousands of electric lamps lit up the decorations
and made the city a blaze of light. What shall I
say for the Harbour? Looking towards this from the
roof garden of a club in Macquarie Street it was a sight to
be remembered but difficult to describe. The surface of
the water, smooth as oil, dark as the overhanging sky,
reflected every one of the myriad lights on the ships resting
on its surface, and the houses lining the foreshores.
Endless ferry-boats, like things of fire alive, rushed hither
and thither. And when the great display of fireworks
began, and hundreds of rockets rose from ship and shore,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
there seemed to be no harbour water, for the reflections of
the roaring rockets were seen apparently to dive into the
earth.</p>
<p>The day of the &#8220;Proclamation&#8221; came. A bright and
sunny morning, followed by a real hot day. The route
of the procession was over four miles long. Immense
crowds lined the streets, and all available space in the
great Centennial Park was covered with people. What
a day to remember! The Commonwealth of Australia
became an actual fact. All the aspirations and all the
desires of the colonies to be one and united were consummated
on that day. What a future lies before it! Before
its twentieth birthday it has made history of which any
young nation may well be proud.</p>
<p>The next and most important function, namely, the
opening of the first Commonwealth Parliament by H.R.H.
the Duke of York, accompanied by the Duchess (their
present Majesties), took place in Melbourne. Their Royal
Highnesses, as may be remembered, travelled to Australia
in the <i>Ophir</i>. Melbourne was not to be outdone in
enthusiasm or loyalty. She vied hard with Sydney to
make herself worthy of the occasion, and well she did it.
But, somehow, she seemed to lack variety in effect. This
I put down&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;to the fact that Melbourne
is a newer city than picturesque old Sydney, and that,
of course, Melbourne does not possess Sydney&#8217;s harbour.
The whole of the royal functions in Melbourne, as well
as those that took place in the individual States, during
the visits of their Royal Highnesses, were carried out with
complete success.</p>
<p>The Duke took the keenest interest in everything, and
insisted on getting information on manifold points of
detail. I may refer to a case in point. At that time the
South African War was still on, but numbers of soldiers
had returned to Australia, amongst them many who had
been granted commissions while serving in South Africa.
Some of the men were members of the Permanent Forces
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
before the war. As these forces were limited in number,
there were no vacancies to employ them as officers on their
return, so it had been decided by the Government that
if they chose they could rejoin, reverting to the rank of
non-commissioned officers they had held previously, and
be granted the honorary rank of their grade on relinquishing
their appointment. The men concerned were by no
means satisfied, and the matter came before the notice of
His Royal Highness.</p>
<p>Just before the <i>Ophir</i> left Adelaide on the return
journey to Western Australia I was sent for on board.
His Royal Highness asked me to explain to him the
position of these men. He strongly objected to the action
that had been taken, with the obvious result that the question
was adjusted by the Government quite satisfactorily.
The chief officials of the Commonwealth had been appointed,
namely, the Governor-General, the Prime
Minister and the members of the Government. The
Members of both Houses of Parliament had been elected,
had taken the oath of allegiance, and were in session. The
three chief departments, which were automatically to be
taken over by the Government from the States were:
first, the Defence Forces; secondly, the Customs Department;
thirdly, the postal services. As regarded the customs
and the post office, these services had been, in each
State, under the able administration of competent civil
servants. The task set for the Government was simply
the selection of chiefs from amongst the officials of the
existing State departments considered best fitted for the
position.</p>
<p>The selection of an officer for the position of Commander-in-Chief
of the Commonwealth forces was quite a
different matter. While the general organization of the
forces of the individual colonies had been run on somewhat
similar lines, there were many anomalies to be eradicated
and many difficult problems to be solved. The seniority
and other claims of the whole of the officers employed on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
the permanent staffs of the different States had first to
be taken into consideration in the military reorganization.
This task alone necessitated much care and thought in
view of the many fairly well paid positions that would be
at the disposal of the Commander-in-Chief. Then the
inauguration and organization of the central administrative
offices and State commands. Further, and all-important,
the preparation of the estimates for the yearly expenditure
at the disposal of the Commander-in-Chief, for on this
naturally depended the establishment to be maintained.
Last and not least, a man possessing the thorough confidence
of the Government, an officer of high repute, with
much tact, was required. At times when I had been riding
across the veldt in South Africa with General Hutton we
had spoken of the coming Federation of the Australian
colonies. He was always watching the news from Australia.
When it was evident that the Act of Parliament
initiating the Commonwealth would receive the Royal
assent I became quite satisfied that Hutton had settled in
his own mind to be the first Commander-in-Chief. As
far as I remember Hutton first came to the front in the
operations in Egypt, when he made a special study of
mounted infantry. He was a firm believer in the usefulness
of this&mdash;then&mdash;new branch of the service. Later on,
when he was appointed Commandant in New South
Wales, he found at hand the very material to train as
mounted riflemen. Australians, as we all know, are excellent
horsemen and first-class shots. The nature of the
country, with the probable forms of attack to which it
might be subjected, lends itself to their use as mounted
riflemen rather than as cavalry. While Commandant in
New South Wales he devoted much of his energy towards
the training of the mounted troops in this direction. An
able soldier, firm in purpose&mdash;somewhat too firm sometimes&mdash;he
did not spare himself in the interests of his men.
Fortunately for him he was the happy possessor of considerable
private means, which, needless to say, helps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
towards independence. But what about tact? During
his term as Commandant in Sydney he had several
differences with those in power. That he did not always
succeed in getting his own way goes without saying. But
at any rate when he left New South Wales the forces of
that State were certainly more efficient than when he took
over the command. His experiences afterwards in Canada
were undoubtedly of value to him, though it would appear
that an unfortunate disagreement between himself and
the Ministers there led to his resignation of that appointment.
Owing to these two former appointments, and to
his having had the command of the Overseas Brigade in
South Africa, it was evident that his claims to be the first
Commander-in-Chief in Australia would receive consideration.
The first Minister of Defence appointed by the
Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, was the Hon. Mr.
Dickson, a Queenslander, who unfortunately died within
ten days of his appointment.</p>
<p>Sir John Forrest, who was afterwards raised to the
peerage, and who since died while on his way home to
take his seat in the House of Lords, took Mr. Dickson&#8217;s
place as Minister of Defence. I remember quite well
dining with him one night in Melbourne when he asked
me what would I think if Hutton were appointed Commander-in-Chief.
I told him that it wasn&#8217;t so much what
I thought, rather that, as he knew him personally pretty
well himself, what did he think? He answered that he
thought it would be all right. &#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, &#8220;you
know best. It&#8217;s you, as Minister, that&#8217;ll have to battle
with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t quarrel with him. It takes two to make a
quarrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I presume, from what you&#8217;ve
told me, that the appointment is practically made. Time
alone will tell.&#8221; General Hutton was appointed, and
within nine months the relations between him and Sir John
became, to say the least of it, more than strained.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>Next in order of importance as regarded appointments
was, to my mind, that of private secretary to the Governor-General.
If there is an office that requires consummate
tact, knowledge and even-minded temperament, commend
me to that of private secretary to a Governor-General.
In his case Lord Hopetoun was fully satisfied to avail
himself of the services of Captain Wallington, with whom
he was already intimately acquainted. Captain Wallington
had served in the capacity of private secretary to
several Governors. I wonder, if he happens to read these
lines, whether he will agree with me that perhaps during
his long term of office he enjoyed the quiet days he spent
in Adelaide with Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, who was
then Governor, as much as any of his time in other
colonies. Captain Wallington, now Sir Edward, must
forgive me if I remind him of the soubriquet by which
his personal friends knew him&mdash;&#8220;Better not.&#8221; All his
friends rejoice in the fact that he is now filling a
very high position of trust and enjoying the best of
health.</p>
<p>I have been following, if you have noticed, the sequence
of appointments which it devolved upon the Government
to make in initiating the Commonwealth. I will continue
this plan as regards the senior positions under the
Commander-in-Chief. At the time of General Hutton&#8217;s
arrival the commands in the several States were held by
the following officers:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>New South Wales: Major-General French (late)
Royal Artillery.</p>
<p>Victoria: Sir Charles Holled Smith&#8217;s term of office
as Commandant had expired shortly before the
inauguration of Federation, and the post was held by
my old friend General Downes, who, on his retirement
finally from the South Australian Command,
had settled in Melbourne, and had been requested by
the Victorian Government to take on the duties of
Commandant temporarily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>Queensland: Major-General Finn, seconded from
the 21st Hussars.</p>
<p>South Australia: I was still Commandant.</p>
<p>Western Australia: Colonel Francis.</p>
<p>Tasmania: Colonel Legge, (late) Royal Artillery.</p>
</div>
<p>Pending the expiration of the terms of service of
Generals French and Finn in New South Wales and
Queensland the first important vacancy to be filled was
that of Commandant of Victoria, held temporarily by
General Downes. This was offered to me and I accepted
it. When the appointment was announced Kingston was
the first to send for me to congratulate me. I felt, indeed,
short of words to thank him for what he had done for
me. I owed so much of my success to him. He was
kind enough to say &#8220;that he could honestly assure me
that if my work had not been satisfactory I would not have
had his support and that of his colleagues and Parliament;
that he was sorry I was leaving South Australia, and he
would prophesy still higher promotion for me in the
future.&#8221;</p>
<p>These words, coupled with the fact that I was once
more to follow my old friend General Downes&#8217;s footsteps
and <i>occupy his chair</i> as Commandant of Victoria, set me
thinking.</p>
<p>I certainly could not follow General Downes again to
higher positions; his retirement from active military work
was final. It was useless to seek for a second &#8220;vision,&#8221;
but it was in my power to renew the resolution I made
years previously, and, remembering Gordon of Khartoum&#8217;s
maxim, &#8220;Never allow your pleasure to interfere
with your duty,&#8221; I fully determined there and then not to
rest until I had reached the highest position in the military
forces of the Commonwealth, and justified Kingston&#8217;s
prophecy.</p>
<p>On being elected to the Federal Parliament Kingston
severed his connexion with the South Australian Government.
It was not long before he made his mark as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
member of the Federal Cabinet. The influence of his
strong personality, his high attainments and sincere belief
in the splendid future of the young Commonwealth,
marked him as a coming Prime Minister. When this
reward seemed to be within his grasp a serious illness
overtook him. After a long spell of enforced idleness
he returned to Parliament. He was a changed man. His
constitution had been impaired beyond recovery. A relapse
followed which resulted fatally. A great man cut
off in the prime of his life&mdash;regretted by all&mdash;a loss to the
Commonwealth.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>COMMANDANT OF VICTORIA</h3>
</div>

<p>My wife and I took up our residence in Melbourne, securing
a comfortable house not far from &#8220;The Grange,&#8221; which
had been the official home of the Commandant of Melbourne
in the earlier days and was then occupied by
General Hutton.</p>
<p>Four years of steady, solid work followed, during
which General Hutton laid the foundations for a sound
organization of the future forces of the Commonwealth.
Contingents of Federal Troops were raised, trained and
dispatched to South Africa. It was a time worth living
for from an official point of view.</p>
<p>Two special occasions are worth noting: one the presentation
of colours to the units which had taken part in the
South African War, and the other the visit of the Japanese
Fleet. With regard to the former, King Edward, ever
ready to recognize the services of those who had joined
the armies to fight for the Empire, presented Colours to
such units of the mounted Commonwealth Forces which
had sent volunteers to the war. The Colours had arrived
in Melbourne, and Colour parties from the units concerned
throughout the Commonwealth were ordered to
assemble in Melbourne for the presentation ceremony.
A parade of the metropolitan troops took place at Albert
Park. It was an inspiring sight, the first practical
recognition the troops had received of the services they
and their comrades had so well and so readily given for
the Empire. This occasion marked only the beginning
of the enthusiasm which the thoughtful action of His
Majesty created throughout the Commonwealth. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
Colours, so dearly valued by the recipients, were welcomed
not only by the soldiers but also by the residents of the
districts to which they belonged.</p>
<p>I hardly feel inclined to enter into the question of the
visit of the Japanese Fleet, either from a political or from
a diplomatic point of view. At the time when it took
place there was no Anglo-Japanese Treaty. The naval
German base in north-eastern Papua was not established.
Unquestionably the peril to Australia of attack by Japan
existed. Upon what grounds the Japanese decided to
send their fleet in force to Australia it is difficult to imagine.
The Japanese Government must have been fully aware of
the fact that Japan was a menace to Australia. What was
their object in proposing to pay a visit which was to
bring them within the territorial waters of a country
which naturally looked upon them as a possible enemy
nation? I have failed to get any information on this
subject.</p>
<p>Whether the Japanese Government approached the
Government of Australia in the matter has never been
made public. The fact remains that their fleet <i>did</i> arrive
in Australian waters, that all possible courtesy was tendered
to them, and that they were given every opportunity to
learn much about Australia and its social and economic
conditions, and to become personally acquainted with its
ports and harbours. The visit of the Japanese Fleet was
not popular with the public at large. The Japanese have
never been <i>personæ gratæ</i> to Australians. Still, when
they arrived they were received in an honest, friendly
way.</p>
<p>A very interesting point arose with reference to their
visit. We were at the time about to hold a review of the
metropolitan military forces in Melbourne by the Governor-General,
and it was suggested to me, as Commandant, that
the Japanese admiral should be invited to send units under
his command to take part thereat. It was my duty to
point out to the Commander-in-Chief that there existed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
an international custom that no troops of a foreign nation
were allowed to land under arms on British soil. As a
matter of fact, I believe this rule applies to all European
nations.</p>
<p>In my mind I doubted whether an invitation to the
Japanese Admiral to send units to take part in the review
under the command of&mdash;to them&mdash;an alien officer,
and to appear without arms, would be acceptable. The
invitation, however, was sent, and an answer was received
to the effect that the Admiral would be glad to avail
himself of it, provided his men would be allowed to carry
their arms. It then became necessary to obtain the approval
of the home authorities to permit them to do so.
Approval was given. The review duly took place, and
some four thousand Japanese sailors and marines took
part in it. I think I am right in stating that this was
the first time that a British officer commanded troops of a
foreign country under arms in time of peace on British
soil.</p>
<p>General Hutton&#8217;s term of office was nearing its end.
For some time previously a movement had been started
to make a radical alteration in the organization of the
forces. Its object was to do away with the position of
Commander-in-Chief and substitute a small Army Council,
assisted by a Military Board. This was following in the
footsteps of what had already taken place at home, where
the post of Commander-in-Chief had been abolished on
the expiration of Lord Wolseley&#8217;s term of office and the
Army Council constituted.</p>
<p>Personally I was against the proposed change. From
my point of view I looked upon it as a risky experiment.
The reorganization of the military forces was still in progress
and a master-mind with full responsibility was
necessary to complete it. Further, the proposed constitution
of a small Army Council and Military Board did not
seem to me to be advisable. My objections were chiefly
with reference to the constitution and duties laid down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
for the Military Board. I submitted a memorandum on
the subject.</p>
<p>The experience I had gained while I held the appointment
of Military Adviser to the Australian Colonies,
1897-99, had taught me how impossible it would be in
time of war, or even in anticipation of a war, to obtain
supplies of warlike stores for Australia, not only from the
Continent of Europe (whence at that time even the Home
Government had to import many essential requirements,
such as searchlights), but from England itself. No further
example of this need be quoted than the one given by me
with reference to the scarcity of small-arm ammunition
at the time of the declaration of war against South Africa.</p>
<p>I had determined therefore that on my return to
Australia I would set myself the task of establishing an
Australian arsenal and an explosive factory.</p>
<p>The advent of the Boer War and afterwards the inauguration
of the Commonwealth of Australia necessarily
postponed any practical action. However, on taking up
my duties as Commandant of Victoria under the Commonwealth
Government, I commenced to school public opinion
in favour of becoming self-supporting in a matter so intimately
and seriously affecting the material interests and
welfare of its people. As regarded the arsenal, Australia
possessed every ingredient required for the manufacture of
every nature of gun, from a 9.2 to a maxim, from .303
rifle and bayonet to a service revolver. Coal, iron ore,
copper, wood, tin, zinc were there in plenty.</p>
<p>Railway engines, agricultural implements, mining
machinery were all being manufactured locally. Why not
guns, mountings, rifles, and so on? Practically similar
conditions applied to explosives.</p>
<p>The change from the Martini-Henry to the .303 Lee-Metford,
and later on from the long to the short Lee-Metford,
left Australia in a sad plight. It was some years
before the Home Government were able to supply the
orders sent from Australia. All through that time the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
local forces and rifle club members suffered from inability
to obtain up-to-date rifles. As a few thousands of the new
rifles arrived they were issued to the partially-paid force,
and their discarded ones were passed on to the volunteers,
and finally, when actually worn out, to the members of the
rifle clubs, who mostly hung them up as trophies of a past
era over their mantle-pieces at their homes, and bought
up-to-date match rifles at their own expense.</p>
<p>The situation was becoming grave; discontent was rife;
interest in rifle shooting was waning fast. The time had
come for a determined effort to force the Government to
take action.</p>
<p>One of many curious facts which it is difficult to account
for is the apathy which often takes hold of a Government
when a plain businesslike proposition is put before
them. My long experience in dealing with Colonial
Governments had taught me that the surest way of
achieving one&#8217;s object was to take into one&#8217;s confidence the
leaders of the Opposition for the time being, convince
them of the soundness and merits of the proposal, and
induce them to adopt the scheme as a plank of their own
policy. Those in power generally resented the Opposition&#8217;s
interference, and at times just out of &#8220;sheer cussedness,&#8221;
refused to move in the matter at issue, forgetting
that more than probably in a few months they themselves
would be sitting disconsolate and minus their Ministerial
salaries on the Opposition benches, while their late
opponents scored heavily by quickly giving effect to the
proposals they themselves had, through that &#8220;sheer cussedness,&#8221;
failed to adopt in the interests of the country. Considering
how short-lived Cabinets were in the early years
of Federation, there was little risk, if any, in carrying out
the above plan.</p>
<p>As a very heavy expenditure would have to be incurred
in establishing an arsenal, small arms and explosives factory,
it was incumbent on me to prove to the Government
that such an expenditure was not only justifiable from a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
national insurance point of view but that it could be made
actually a money-saving proposition, apart from the fact
that, by utilizing Australian products and labour, as well
as local inventive talent, all the money spent would remain
in the country instead of passing on into the hands of
strangers.</p>
<p>In order to ascertain the probable expenditure of a
plant capable of turning out from thirty to forty thousand
rifles per annum, I personally arranged for confidential
agents to make thorough inquiries in England, America
and Germany, and while awaiting their report to me I
gave my attention to the selection of a suitable site.</p>
<p>The coal mining town of Lithgow, situated some eighty
miles west of Sydney, possessed so many advantages that
my choice was soon made. Leaving Sydney, the plain
extends as far as Penrith, which lies at the foot of a high
range happily named the Blue Mountains. The train
which serves the western districts climbs its way to
Katoomba and Mount Victoria, the highest point, through
wonderfully picturesque scenery, and then descends rapidly
to low levels, emerging at the town of Lithgow, a branch
line connecting it with the southern railways system via
Blayney and Young. The coal deposits at Lithgow are
extensive; large fields of iron ore are available at no great
distance further west. Iron and steel works on a big scale
were in process of being established. Every consideration
pointed to the suitability of the site, and, as a matter of
fact, no voice was raised against it.</p>
<p>Later on I received the reports of my agents. Those
from Germany were unsatisfactory. A close examination
of the English and American estimates of cost showed
that the English prices were exorbitant, and, in addition,
the time-limit I had set for the delivery of and setting up
the machinery at Lithgow, namely, eighteen months,
could not be guaranteed by the English firms.</p>
<p>Armed now with full information, I submitted the proposal
to the Government, the Minister for Defence at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
time being my old acquaintance, Mr. Playford, from South
Australia.</p>
<p>The Press and the leaders of the Opposition supported
the proposal, and the Government went so far as to approve
of inquiries being instituted by the Defence Department
as to the probable cost and other points of importance.
Mr. Playford appointed one of our officers then in
England to co-operate with the High Commissioner for
the purpose. I had not deemed it necessary to inform Mr.
Playford of my private inquiries, simply pointing out to
him that in my opinion the factory could be established at
a satisfactory figure.</p>
<p>Probably through lack of sufficient experience, the result
of the inquiries by the officer selected was a report
as to cost which practically damned the proposition. Mr.
Playford was annoyed that I had so insistently expressed
my opinion that the cost would not be prohibitory, and,
as he put it in his curt way, he told me I had practically
made a fool of him. I did not allow myself to be put
out by his rudeness, as General Owen had done, but
smiled and asked him if the Government had decided to
turn the proposal down definitely. If so I would be
obliged if he could let me have an official minute to that
effect, as I had another course to suggest for his consideration.
On receipt of his minute I requested a further interview
with him. My new proposal was that I was prepared
to give up my appointment and establish the factory
myself, provided the Government agreed to take 20,000
rifles a year for seven years at the price which we were
then paying the War Office, and that at the end of the
seven years the Government could take the concern over at
a valuation if they so desired. This offer I put in writing
and I let it be widely known that I had made it.</p>
<p>Mr. Playford was once more annoyed. He could not
understand how it could pay me to throw up my career
to undertake a job which his advisers had reported upon
so adversely. If he had been let down by them, my offer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
accepted, and I scored a success, what opinion would the
public form of him? In order to avoid falling between
two stools he decided to recommend to the Government to
call for tenders throughout the world. I had impressed
upon him that this was essential in order to test the <i>bona
fides</i> of the tenderers. Tenders were called for. I had
gained my point, for I knew that if the confidential
reports of my agents were fairly correct, the amount of
the American tenders would be close on 50 per cent. lower
than any others, as no European country, bar England
and Germany, was in a position to undertake the order.
I accordingly then informed Mr. Playford of my views
on the matter and patiently waited for the day when the
tenders were due. I shall not forget Mr. Playford&#8217;s
chagrin when he found that my forecast had been verified
to the letter. If I remember correctly the American lowest
tender was some £97,000, the lowest English one some
£140,000. As the tenderers were a well-known firm of
high standing in the United States (contractors to their
Government) their offer was accepted and the factory was
established at Lithgow.</p>
<p>I had been successful all round, and scored at last off
Playford.</p>
<p>General Hutton left Australia; the Army Council and
Military Board were established. General Finn, a cavalry
officer, who, at the time of the inauguration of the
Commonwealth in 1901 was Commandant of Queensland,
and had afterwards succeeded General French as Commandant
in New South Wales, was appointed Inspector-General.
General Hoad became Chief of the General
Staff and Senior Member of the Military Board.</p>
<p>My term of office as Commandant of Victoria expired.
I was offered the command of &#8220;The Mother State,&#8221; New
South Wales, which became vacant on the appointment
of General Finn as Inspector-General. I accepted. It
was one more step to my final goal.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>COMMANDANT OF NEW SOUTH WALES</h3>
</div>

<p>Shortly after I took up the command in New South Wales
an incident occurred which gave the first real impetus to
the serious consideration and final adoption by the Government
of the system of universal service as proposed by
me eleven years before when Commandant in Adelaide.
I had arranged to read a paper to my officers in New South
Wales. Owing to the fact that our own military institute
was not sufficiently large to accommodate them we had
made arrangements to hire one of the big public halls,
and we had decided to ask the Lord Mayor of Sydney,
Alderman Allan Taylor, to take the chair and to send
invitations to many of the chief citizens to be present.
My object in reading this paper was to push on the
question of universal service. The title I had selected
for the lecturette was, &#8220;What has Australia done for the
Australians, and What are Australians doing for Australia?&#8221;
After I had finished the Lord Mayor made a
few remarks with reference to the subject at issue and
concluded by moving a vote of thanks. This was really
outside our practice at the institute. I thanked the Lord
Mayor for his kind remarks, and in quite a colloquial
way said that it was distressing to go round the public
parks about Sydney on holidays and Saturday afternoons
and see thousands of young men sitting on fences smoking
cigarettes, content to loaf and look on while a few men
played games. It happened that the previous Saturday
had been the last day of one of the cricket Test Matches,
against England played at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
The attendance thereat had been enormous, as usual&mdash;some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
thirty-five thousand people. The next morning I
was astonished when I got the morning papers to see the
following headings: &#8220;The Citizens of Sydney insulted....
Forty thousand loafers at the Sydney Cricket
Ground. So says our new Commandant, General
Gordon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then followed a statement to the effect that while
addressing the officers under his command and many
eminent citizens the evening before, the general had stated
that on the previous Saturday he had been present at the
Sydney Cricket Ground and had seen thousands of loafers
whose time would have been far better taken up if they
had been devoting it to fitting themselves for the defence
of their country, and that they (the newspaper reporters)
considered it a very undeserved reflection on the thousands
who were watching the big tussle at the Test Match.</p>
<p>Knowing full well that these headings would have been
telegraphed to the Press throughout Australia and have
appeared therein that same morning, I at once wired to
the Military Board, for the information of the Minister,
to the effect that the newspaper reports were inaccurate.
I was reported also to have stated that I had ready for
the consideration of the Government a scheme which
would form the basis upon which to found a system of
universal service. This latter part of their report was
correct. I had made that statement. I had prepared the
scheme in Adelaide eleven years before.</p>
<p>Shortly after sending my wire to the Military Board
I received one from them drawing my attention to the
Press reports and requesting an explanation as to their
correctness as regarded the &#8220;thousands of loafers,&#8221; and
further desiring to be informed if the statement as to the
scheme for universal service was accurate, and, if so,
instructing me to forward it for the information of the
Minister by the first post. My own telegram, which had
crossed theirs, had answered their first question. With
reference to the second I notified them that the scheme
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
would be posted that afternoon. I can reproduce here
the actual document which I sent down. It read as
follows:</p>
<p>SCHEME for the defence of the Commonwealth of Australia,
based on the recognition by the citizens of the Commonwealth of
the personal responsibility on the part of one and all to prepare
themselves in time of peace so as to enable them to bear their
share of the burden of the protection of the Commonwealth and
Empire in time of war.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<div style='margin-top:1em'></div>
<p>I</p>
<div style='margin-top:1em'></div>
<p>GENERAL VIEW OF PRESENT SITUATION</p>
</div>

<p>It is submitted that:</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The national growth of a nation depends on the recognition
of the personal responsibility of that nation&#8217;s citizens
to develop her industrial and commercial interests and the
integrity thereof.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) In the present economic conditions of a young nation
such as Australia (an island continent containing an area of
practically one-third of the British Empire whose population
totals only some five millions of inhabitants), it is not considered
advisable or even practicable to establish and maintain
a standing army of sufficient strength to enable the nation
to put its trust for its protection on such a standing army and,
thereby, relieve the rest of its male inhabitants from the responsibility
of service in case of an invasion.</p>
<p>The maintenance of such a standing army would, it is
urged, be a direct loss, as it would severely cripple the best
interests of the economic development of the nation in time
of peace, specially in the early years of the nation&#8217;s growth,
and it would entail an expenditure not justifiable under such
circumstances.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) On the other hand, it is contested that, if a system of
training every young man can be devised:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>1stly, To have a sound mind in a sound body;</p>
<p>2ndly, To submit to military discipline;</p>
<p>3rdly, To shoot straight;</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>and</p>
</div>

<p>4thly, To learn sufficient drill to enable him to fulfil his
duties in the ranks with such knowledge and intelligence
as will give him the necessary confidence in
himself;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
and that system is so carried out that it does not interfere
in any way with the industrial, professional, or commercial
avocations of such young men, then the foundation will be
laid of a national defence force based on the highest principles
of citizenship which will be of the greatest value for home
defence or to fight away from her shores in the interests of
the Empire.</p>
</div>
<div class='ce'>
<div style='margin-top:1em'></div>
<p>II</p>
<div style='margin-top:1em'></div>
<p>WHAT IS THE SYSTEM PROPOSED?</p>
</div>

<p>The system aims at securing for every young man:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>1st, A sound mind in a sound body;</p>
<p>2nd, A disciplined mind;</p>
<p>3rd, The ability to shoot straight;</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>and</p>
</div>

<p>4th, A sufficient knowledge of drill to give him confidence
in the field.</p>
</div>
<p>The first requirement&mdash;that of securing &#8220;a sound mind in a
sound body&#8221;&mdash;can only be successfully accomplished by a very
carefully thought out and progressive method of training the mental
and physical qualities of our boys from the time when they first
go to school. The training of the youthful minds may be safely
left to the Education Departments; it is necessarily commensurate
with the individual capabilities of the boys.</p>
<p>The physical training can be accomplished, and is already so
accomplished in certain schools, by a progressive system of physical
culture. There is no difficulty in providing a manual of physical
culture for boys which shall be progressive and uniform in character,
and which can be taught in all schools by the teachers themselves;
in fact, one has been already prepared at my suggestion
by Mr. Weber, Melbourne.</p>
<p>The second requirement&mdash;that of securing &#8220;a disciplined mind.&#8221;
Here again it is essential to commence to instil the principles
which form a disciplined mind as early as possible in the boy&#8217;s
early youth. Self-denial, obedience to the orders of their superiors,
and respect and affection for their elders, are perhaps the most
important of these principles.</p>
<p>This task may again be safely left to the officers of the Education
Department.</p>
<p>It will be seen, therefore, that the first two requirements may
be obtained by a system, as advocated above, to be imparted to all
boys in their early youth by those who are charged with their
elementary education, and it is urged that such system should be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
uniform and form part of the school curriculum, the teachers being
required to qualify to impart the necessary instruction.</p>
<p>The third requirement&mdash;&#8220;the ability to shoot straight.&#8221; Here
again the earlier in life a boy is taught to handle firearms safely
the more probable it will be that he will become a straight shot
in his manhood.</p>
<p>In this respect it is pointed out that such instruction could not
be expected, except, in some cases, to be given by the teachers,
who could not reasonably be called upon to qualify themselves to
teach the use of the rifle as experts. It therefore becomes necessary
that qualified instructors should be provided to attend all
schools and superintend personally the training of such boys as
shall prove their capabilities to be trusted in the actual use of the
rifle with ball cartridge.</p>
<p>It will be seen that it is only in the attainment of this third
requirement that an extra expenditure to that now incurred is
required by the employment of expert instructors.</p>
<p>Now for the fourth requirement&mdash;&#8220;a sufficient knowledge of
drill to give a man confidence in the field.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this respect it is well to give such statistics as are available
in order to grasp thoroughly the nature of difficulties that have to
be encountered in achieving the object aimed at.</p>
<p>It is submitted that the statistics available for the State of New
South Wales apply equally to the other States of the Commonwealth
pro rata of their population.</p>
<p>In New South Wales in December, 1904, there were:</p>
<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>17,467</td><td align='left' colspan='4'> male children between the ages of</td><td align='left'> 12</td><td align='left'> and</td><td align='left'> 13</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>Of the above number of male children the following were
attending schools:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='center' colspan='4'>Between</td><td align='center'>Public<br />Schools.</td><td align='center'>Private<br />Schools.</td><td align='center'>Total.</td><td align='center'>Out of</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left' colspan='4'>12 and 13 years</td><td align='right'>12,650</td><td align='right'>3,160</td><td align='right'>15,810</td><td align='right'>17,467</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>13</td><td align='left'>"</td><td align='left'>14</td><td align='left'>"</td><td align='right'>11,400</td><td align='right'>2,840</td><td align='right'>14,240</td><td align='right'>17,214</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>It is evident that the falling off of 50 per cent. at the age of
14-15 years and of 75 per cent. at 15-16 years proves that the
schools cannot and are not to be depended upon as the training
ground of the nation&#8217;s boyhood beyond the age of 14-15 years; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
that at the very time when that training would be naturally expected,
if continued, to reach the most satisfactory results, namely,
from 15 to 18 years of age, the boys are removed from the
schools, in natural compliance with the demands of the economic
conditions of citizenship in the nation, and that unless some satisfactory
means is devised to compulsorily compel those boys who
have left school to continue to be trained up to the age of at least
19 years, the earliest age at which young men may be considered
capable of undergoing the bodily fatigue necessary to give them
sufficient knowledge of such drill as will ensure that confidence in
the field so essential to success as a fighting unit, it would appear
evident that the foundation previously laid by the attainment of the
first and second requirements as a whole, and the third requirement
in part, will remain a foundation only, and the superstructure
thereon will not be completed.</p>
<p>It is on the above grounds that it is contested that the cadet
system, as popularly understood, is not considered to be reliable
as a solution to the fulfilment of the requirements laid down for the
training of a citizen soldier.</p>
<p>It is now pointed out that it is reasonable to argue that:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>1st. It may be considered equally undesirable to compel
boys from 15 to 19 years of age as to compel young men from
18 to 23 years of age to be partially trained.</p>
<p>2ndly. It will hardly be denied that the partial training of
young men from 18 to 25 years of age in the field will give
better results than the training of boys from 15 to 19 years of
age, and on these premises it is urged that, to attain the fourth
requirement, all young men from 18 to 25 should be partially
trained, and thereby build on the foundation laid down by the
attainment of the 1st and 2nd requirements and part of the
third.</p>
</div>
<p>But, can some practical means be suggested which will maintain
the boys&#8217; interest in their work during the gap made by the period
taken from the time that a boy leaves school and that when he
reaches the age of 18, without interfering with the performance of
those duties of his civil life for which he may be preparing himself?</p>
<p>The following suggestion is submitted, namely, the establishment
in all centres of population of public gymnasia for the
training in physical culture, and that rifle shooting by means of
miniature ranges, and, further, the imposing upon those who employ
lads up to 18 years of age, the obligation of enabling such lads to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
attend a course of instruction during each year at these gymnasia
at such times as may be deemed advisable, provided such training
is not made irksome to the lads themselves or detrimental to their
employers&#8217; interests or their own.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>III</p>
<div style='margin-top:1em'></div>
<p>SCHEME PROPOSED</p>
</div>

<p>The scheme proposed therefore comprises:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>1st. A general uniform system of mental and physical
culture in all schools up to the time when the boy leaves
school.</p>
<p>2ndly. The scientific training necessary to develop a
disciplined mind in all schools.</p>
<p>The above to be under the direct supervision of the Education
Departments.</p>
<p>3rdly. The teaching of schoolboys to shoot straight under
expert supervision.</p>
<p>4thly. The establishment of public gymnasia for the training
in physical culture and rifle shooting up to 18 years for
lads who have left school.</p>
<p>5thly. Universal annual partial training in drill, also the
special encouragement of all manly sports without interference
with their civil occupations.</p>
<p>And finally, the formation of rifle clubs for all citizens between
25 and 60 years of age throughout the Commonwealth,
with the fullest facilities for the encouragement of rifle
shooting.</p>
</div>
<p>This my scheme was adopted in its entirety. A study
of the Act of Parliament instituting it will show that the
whole of the provisions suggested above were fully met.</p>
<p>But to return to the consequences of the Press reports.
I had called upon the editors to contradict the statements
attributed to me as regarded the loafing on the cricket
ground, but pointed out at the same time that I had fully
meant what I had said with reference to the great waste
of time and the failure on the part of thousands of young
men to fit themselves for the defence of their country,
owing to the absence of some form of legislation which
would make it necessary for them to devote some of their
time to the development of their physical and moral welfare.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
The Press, as a whole, fully acquitted me of any
intentional desire to call those who had attended the Test
Match loafers. They also assured me that they were in
full agreement with my remarks otherwise, and with the
end such remarks had in view, that they fully intended to
start a campaign with a view of bringing about the necessary
legislation for universal service on the lines suggested
by me, and would not rest until that object was achieved.
This they accomplished.</p>
<p>As is now well known, by an Act of Parliament in 1909
the principle of the universal liability for all males from
12 to 25 years of age to be trained for military service
was made law for the first time in any English-speaking
community, and I was more than satisfied that my
personal views which I had held for so many years,
ever since in South Australia, in 1895, I had prepared the
first scheme for the approval of Charles Cameron Kingston,
had actually become the law of the land.</p>
<p>Before leaving this subject I must give praise to those
officers and citizens who, taking up the question at issue
after the reading of my lecturette and the events which
followed, formed the Defence League of Australia, and
published a paper named <i>The Call</i>, which never once
failed in unhesitatingly and most strenuously calling on
Parliament, the citizens, and the Government of Australia
to bring about the introduction of the Universal Service
system. Its leading spirit was Colonel Gerald Campbell,
of Moss Vale, a most energetic Volunteer officer.</p>
<p>An amusing incident occurred the night that I was
entertained by some of my friends at the Union Club on
taking up the command at Sydney. After dinner we
played bridge. Mr. X, who had not been long married
and had got into the habit of &#8217;phoning home in the evenings
that his business kept him in town, was asked to
play at my table. His wife did not relish his rather constant
absences and sternly refused to go to sleep until he
returned home at night. This annoyed him much. Result,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
some arguments when he reached home. On the
night in question we played till about 3 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>A.M.</span> &#8220;Surely,&#8221;
thought Mr. X as he drove home, &#8220;the wife will be asleep
to-night.&#8221; Very silently he entered his house, undressed,
and opened the door of their bedroom. It was all lighted
and his charming partner very much awake. Tableau!</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;look at the clock&mdash;4 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>A.M.</span> I am
full up. You can leave this room, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my dear,&#8221; he answered her; &#8220;to-night was not
my fault at all. You see, we gave a dinner to our new
Commandant, General Gordon, and then we played bridge.
I was asked to play at his table. The old man [<i>sic!</i>]
would not go to bed, so I had to stay. So you see, I
could not help myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;You have told me
many tarradiddles before; now you want to make an
ignorant fool of me. Well, I am not one. I do happen
to know that General Gordon is dead! Go away.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>LORD KITCHENER&#8217;S VISIT TO AUSTRALIA</h3>
</div>

<p>Shortly after the initiation of the Universal Service
system, the Government was met with the difficulty of
providing the necessarily increasing cost. On the estimates
being framed for the ensuing year it was found
that the expenditure was somewhat heavier than had
been anticipated. The Government had followed my
advice so far and were quite prepared to urge Parliament
to find the money, but they considered it would be most
desirable to get the highest military opinion procurable
to support them in doing so. How was this to be done?
There was only one solution. I advised the Commonwealth
Government to approach the Imperial Government
with a view to their sending an Imperial officer of highest
standing to report, whose opinion, if favourable to the
system as inaugurated, would be of the greatest possible
value in backing their demands for sufficient funds to
meet all its requirements.</p>
<p>Lord Kitchener was selected by the War Office, instructed
to visit Australia, make a thorough inspection,
inquire fully into the progress made with the initiation
of the system, report whether it was sound in principle
and practice, and, if it met with his approval, suggest such
modifications as he considered advisable.</p>
<p>Lord Kitchener arrived at Port Darwin on December
21, 1910. Advantage was taken of his visit by the Commonwealth
Government, not only to obtain his opinion as
to the merits or otherwise of the Universal Service scheme,
but also a report upon the efficiency and the standard
of training existing at the time in the Commonwealth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
Forces. I was at the time Commandant of New South
Wales.</p>
<p>I arranged for a camp of continuous training for the
whole of our States&#8217; field forces, to be held at the Liverpool
Area from January 5-12 inclusive, and for the Garrison
troops at their respective war stations.</p>
<p>As it may interest soldiers to see the nature of the work
carried out during the camp, I quote from the &#8220;general

</div>
<p>On the morning of January 5, 1910, Lord Kitchener
and his staff arrived by train from Brisbane at Newcastle,
New South Wales. Only the local garrison troops were
in camp there, the local units of the Field Forces having
proceeded to the general camp at Liverpool.</p>
<p>The question of the fixed defences at Newcastle was
at the time causing considerable anxiety owing to disturbances
in the ground due to the coal mines. The construction
of a new fort had been decided upon and its position
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
selected. The whole day was spent in making a most
careful examination of the harbour, the coast line and the
existing forts. Lord Kitchener in his report approved
of the site chosen.</p>
<p>He arrived at the Liverpool camp on the next morning,
Thursday the 6th, at 7.15 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>A.M.</span> Early morning parades
were being held by all corps. He watched some units at
work and then went to the quarters prepared for him.
After breakfast he at once began his inspection, and from
that time until he left the camp, three days afterwards,
there was practically not an idle moment.</p>
<p>When we were inspecting the camp lines Kitchener
was rather interested in the incinerators I had ordered to
be used for the first time. An old Irish ex-soldier employed
as a camp policeman was asked by the general
how they were working. &#8220;Fine, sir,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And
what are they called?&#8221; &#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; said Pat, &#8220;I am not
quite sure, but I think they call them <i>insinuators</i>.&#8221;
Kitchener had a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>On the Thursday evening I was ordered to arrange for
a certain small portion of the troops to leave camp at two
o&#8217;clock next morning under the command of an officer
specially selected. Their destination was not divulged.
The remainder of the troops under my command were to
bivouac at a place called Signal Hill, some three miles
from the camp, at 7 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>A.M.</span> next day and await instructions.
These orders were carried out. Sharp at half-past seven
Lord Kitchener and his staff rode up to Signal Hill. I
was not aware of the whereabouts of the small force that
had left the camp at 2 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>A.M.</span></p>
<p>He sent for me and informed me that he had prepared
me a task to be carried out at once. The idea was that
an enemy&#8217;s convoy and escort&mdash;which was composed of
the troops we had detached the night before&mdash;were marching
along certain roads following up an enemy column.
The position of the column of the enemy&#8217;s troops and
convoy were roughly given. My business was to capture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
the convoy with the troops at my disposal, and he wished
me to at once give my orders to my commanding officers
for carrying out my plans. The commanding officers
were assembled without delay. My own mind was soon
made up as to my plans. The orders were given, and
within a quarter of an hour of the time when I had left
Lord Kitchener my troops were on the move.</p>
<p>An amusing incident happened afterwards. One of
my cavalry brigades had been ordered to cut off the
convoy. It had done so and was moving rapidly to close
in on it. I myself was riding with them; it was the last
phase of the attack. Knowing that the man&oelig;uvre was over,
for we had captured the convoy, and seeing Lord Kitchener
and his staff not very far away, I rode up to him to report.
With something of a smile on his face he said to me when
I reached him, &#8220;Have you come to surrender yourself?
Because, if not, I am going to make you a prisoner. I
am here with your enemy, who has four guns at this
point&#8221; (they were imaginary), &#8220;you must stay here
with me.&#8221; So I was taken prisoner. He then asked me
to explain to him the position of my troops at that moment.
In doing so I told him that, on our right, along the crest
of the hill on which the convoy was travelling, I had an
infantry brigade. The edge of this hill, right along, was
covered with fairly thick bush, some three to four feet
high; I had ordered the infantry to creep right up, keeping
under cover to within some sixty yards of the top of the
ridge without showing themselves, lie down, and keep as
quiet as possible until such time a certain whistle signal
was given, when they were to rise and collar the convoy.</p>
<p>When I explained to Lord Kitchener that the infantry
were quite handy, he said, &#8220;Well, I want to see them.&#8221;
I gave the whistle signal agreed upon, and immediately,
for a distance of some three-quarters of a mile along the
ridge, on the flank of the convoy, up jumped a couple of
thousand infantry. It was my opportunity now, so I
ventured to tell him that, as the convoy and the four guns
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
were now in my hands, I took it that my troops had
rescued me and that I was afraid he was my prisoner. He
laughed and said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to order the &#8216;Cease
fire&#8217; to sound, which puts an end to the morning&#8217;s work,
and then I am free.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was an inspiring morning, that morning, a fine day.
Everyone was most keen and anxious in his work. All
knew that Kitchener&#8217;s critical eye had been upon them all
the morning. He had ridden from place to place watching
their work. They had been on the march for some eight
hours and were now assembled for the return to their
camp, six miles off. He took up his stand on the side
of the road and watched them as they marched past homewards.
Practically every man at the time serving in the
Field Forces in New South Wales was present. They
came from every part of the State. The attendance
reached the very high average of close on 97 per cent.</p>
<p>After his inspection of the Field Forces the garrison
troops and the fortress defences had to be inspected. The
garrison troops, the units detailed for the defence of the
forts and harbour, were inspected on Saturday afternoon,
having taken up their positions in accordance with the
local scheme of defence. Afterwards visits to the forts
occupied the time till late at night. Finally we embarked
on board the submarine mine-layer, the <i>Miner</i>, to watch
the working of the searchlights protecting the mine fields
and navigable channels. Close on midnight the inspection
was finished and we returned to Government House.</p>
<p>Before we reached the landing-stage Lord Kitchener
asked me to get him a sheet of paper. I did so. He then
said, &#8220;I wish you to publish this Order to-morrow.&#8221;
Taking his pencil, he wrote as follows:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;To General Gordon. Be good enough to inform the
officers, non-commissioned officers and men under your
command of my appreciation of the keen interest and great
zeal they have shown in carrying out their duties
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
during my lengthy inspection. They are doing well, and
it has been a pleasure to me to have been present with them
during their period of continuous training.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>&#8220;(<i>Signed</i>) <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Kitchener</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>This Order, I knew, of course, would be most acceptable
to all concerned. Next day, just previous to their
leaving for Melbourne, Captain Fitzgerald, his personal
secretary and close friend&mdash;who later on, unfortunately,
was drowned with him&mdash;told me that I should be proud
to receive that Order, as he had never known &#8220;the Chief&#8221;
to have issued one in a similar manner before. During
his visit he reminded me of the conversation we had in
South Africa when I asked Lord Roberts&#8217;s and his
opinions on my scheme for the Universal Service. He
heartily congratulated me on having achieved what then he
thought my too ambitious hopes, and assured me he would
support the movement heart and soul. This he did, as
his report proved.</p>
<p>I think it only fair to the Government of that day to
say that they did carry out the whole of his recommendations,
and that every one of his suggestions was in force
within three years after his visit.</p>
<p>Practically all men of any importance, politicians, business
men, working men, one and all enthusiastically
helped. A considerable improvement was noticed, not
only in the general bearing of the trainees, but what was
much more important, in their physical and moral development.
The keenness of the lads themselves was proved
by the extra time voluntarily devoted by them to receiving
instruction to qualify as officers and non-commissioned
officers, attending courses of lectures, special parades and
rifle matches. The police authorities throughout the
Commonwealth were asked to watch carefully and report
as to whether, in their opinion, the system was influencing
the character of the boys generally, and if so in what
directions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>In 1914 reports were received from the police in all the
States. They were unanimous in stating that, &#8220;in their
opinion, the behaviour of the youths who were subjected
to the training had vastly improved, and that the principal
effects of a beneficial nature were increased self-respect,
diminution of juvenile cigarette smoking, &#8216;larrikinism,&#8217;
and generally a tendency towards a sense of responsibility
and a desire to become good citizens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wherefore it is seen that the chief aims as laid down
in my scheme have been fully realized, namely, to
secure:&mdash;</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>(1). A sound mind in a sound body;</p>
<p>(2). A disciplined mind;</p>
<p>(3). Ability to shoot straight; and</p>
<p>(4). Sufficient knowledge of drill to secure self-confidence in the field.</p>
</div>
<p>Some time after Lord Kitchener&#8217;s tour of inspection
the first flying machine arrived in Sydney. It was sent
out by the Bristol Company&mdash;a biplane of the most primitive
kind, where the pilot sat on the front of the lower
plane with his feet resting on a board, and the passenger
squatted behind him with the engine racing at his back.
There was, of course, considerable excitement in Sydney
and much curiosity to see it in the air. We were holding
a camp of instruction for the mounted troops at Liverpool,
and the proprietors of the aeroplane suggested a flight
from Sydney to the camp, some twenty miles, and asked
permission to carry it out. I naturally agreed.</p>
<p>It was a perfect summer&#8217;s morning when, at about
7 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>A.M.</span>, a small black spot was seen high up in the air;
it was the flying machine rapidly approaching the camp
at a height of some 3,000 feet. It landed safely on a spot
previously selected, much to the delight of the men in
camp, most of whom came from the country districts.
The Governor-General, Lord Dudley, was in camp with
us, and was anxious to be taken up, and I personally also
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
intended to arrange likewise. Something, however, intervened,
with the result that the pilot left the camp before
we returned to lunch after the morning&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the camp I returned to the
barracks. The morning after I was going into breakfast
when a messenger arrived from the manager of the Bristol
Company with a letter inviting me to be the first to fly
over Sydney, and asking me to go out to the Ascot Race
Course at about eleven o&#8217;clock, where the machine was
quartered. I drove out, and on my arrival I was told that
the pilot was away but that the mechanic, a young Scotsman
of about twenty years of age, who had a pilot&#8217;s
certificate, was available if I wished to trust myself to him.
I certainly felt rather doubtful on the point when I looked
at the youth, especially as he had not been up in it himself
since his arrival in Australia. However, I took courage,
said, &#8220;Right you are,&#8221; and scrambled up behind him.
The engines were started, she sped along the grass, and
before I could realize it we were some 500 feet high up in
the air, still rising and sailing over Botany Bay. As the
manager had told Macdonald to go wherever I directed
him, I decided to fly over Sydney and the harbour, so
that I should pass over the barracks, the forts, Government
House, the Post Office and the principal streets of Sydney
and give the public a fair opportunity of watching us.</p>
<p>It was a lovely day; the machine behaved splendidly.
Young Macdonald was as cool as a cucumber, and we returned
and landed at the Ascot Race Course after two
hours of a delightful experience. I regret to say that my
youthful pilot was killed during the early days of the war;
his machine dived into the Thames and he was drowned.</p>
<p>Some years later I selected the site for and established
at Point Cook near Melbourne the first Flying School in
Australia.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE AMERICAN NAVAL VISIT</h3>
</div>

<p>The next big event of importance after Lord Kitchener&#8217;s
tour of inspection was the arrival of the American Fleet.
Whether the visit of this fleet, which comprised practically
the full strength of the American Navy, had any connexion
with the visit of the Japanese Fleet which I have already
told you about, I do not know. Was it by way of a
demonstration in force in the waters of the Pacific in
answer to the display made by the Japanese? Had it a
political aspect in other ways? Or was it purely a pleasure
trip, arranged by the American Government to give their
naval officers and men an extended tour for purposes of
instruction and pleasure? Who can tell? I cannot.
But I can testify to the pleasurable times they had during
their lengthy stay at the several ports they visited.</p>
<p>Sydney woke up again. The occasion had arrived to
remember the great days of the inauguration of the Commonwealth.
Sydney wanted to decorate herself again and
to look her best, and she certainly succeeded. Though
somewhat different in detail, the decorations of the city
and streets were as gorgeous as those of 1901, on the
inauguration of the Commonwealth, and everyone was
determined to give the Americans (and incidentally himself)
a real good time. It is doubtful if the foreshores
of the great harbour of Sydney will ever hold again so
many thousands of spectators as they did on that glorious
morning when, at 11 <span style='font-variant: small-caps' class='lowercase'>A.M.</span>, the leading warship of the
American fleet entered the Heads, and, clearing the inner
point of the South Heads, made direct for the anchorage
up the harbour, followed by the remaining fifteen men-of-war.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>Previous to the arrival of the fleet a question had arisen
which had much exercised the Government and civic
authorities of Sydney. It was understood that during the
stay of the fleet in Sydney Harbour&mdash;about ten days&mdash;there
would be, daily, visiting the city anywhere from six
to ten thousand officers and men on liberty leave. The
authorities thought that it would be advisable to make
some provision for military picquets and extra police in
case of disturbances, and they approached me with a view to
our supplying the wished-for military assistance. I pointed
out that there was positively no precedent for such action,
especially in the case of visiting guests. It was the privilege
of the guests to look after the behaviour of their own
men and to land their own picquets if they considered them
necessary. At the same time I ventured to suggest that
it might be thought advisable to enrol a number of special
constables&mdash;who, of course, would be in plain clothes and
unknown&mdash;to assist the police if required. It is to the
credit of the officers and men of the American Fleet that
during their stay in Sydney, though thousands landed
daily and many were allowed over-night leave, no disturbances
of any kind occurred, and to see any one of them
the worse for drink was the exception.</p>
<p>Naturally, throughout the whole of the State of New
South Wales, right to the very backblocks, there was an
earnest wish on the part of the members of the New South
Wales military forces to be in Sydney at the time of the
fleet&#8217;s visit. So I had arranged to hold the annual camp
of Continuous Training at that period. The attendance
in this camp almost beat the record of the one we had held
at the time of Lord Kitchener&#8217;s visit.</p>
<p>As usual the public were very anxious for a review to
be held, and the matter was freely aired in the Press. The
Government of New South Wales was only too glad to
meet their wishes, and requested me to make the necessary
arrangements. Here then was a repetition of what had
occurred in Melbourne at the time of the visit of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
Japanese Fleet. The same difficulty was in the way&mdash;that
no troops of a foreign country were permitted to land
under arms on British soil. I pointed this out to the
Government, but drew their attention to the fact that a
precedent had been established in the case of the Japanese
Fleet at the time of their visit to Melbourne, and that an
application to the Imperial Government to permit the
Americans to do so would doubtless receive a favourable
answer. The application was sent and approval given.
I then put the arrangements for the review in hand. I had
an interview with the American Commander-in-Chief, who
informed me that he would land a contingent, representing
the fleet, of somewhere between six and seven thousand
men. Our own fleet was, of course, in Sydney Harbour
at the time, and our admiral told me that he would land
somewhere over three thousand ratings. My own troops
mustered about some twelve thousand, with the typical
and favourite arm of the service in Australia, the Mounted
Rifles, in full strength.</p>
<p>The morning of the review arrived. Once again it was a
glorious day. On all occasions throughout my many years
of command when &#8220;functions,&#8221; reviews, or camps of training
took place, &#8220;Queen&#8217;s weather&#8221; had always been my
good fortune. The crowd that gathered at Centennial
Park to witness the review rivalled that which had witnessed
the arrival of the fleet. It was put down at some
three hundred and fifty thousand people. The actual
number of troops on parade was over twenty-one thousand,
of which some four thousand were mounted troops. It
was no easy task to man&oelig;uvre this number of troops on
the restricted space at Centennial Park, especially as I had
arranged, much to the delight of the people, for the
mounted troops to gallop past the saluting point as a final
<i>tour de force</i> before the last advance in review order.
However, with the assistance of an able staff and preliminary
conferences with my commanding officers, the review
passed off without the slightest hitch. Just as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
presence of the Japanese sailors under arms at the review
had established a record in Melbourne, so did that of the
Americans establish one in Sydney, and, for the second
time, I had the honour of commanding armed forces of a
Foreign Nation on parade on British soil.</p>
<p>One more incident of the review. There had been
thousands of the inhabitants of Sydney who were naturally
unable to witness it but were most anxious to see the foreign
sailors. I had arranged with their naval Commander-in-Chief
that he should land at different landing-stages on
the several quays of the harbour. By this means residents
in many parts of Sydney would see them marching past
their homes. The distances from these landing-stages to
Centennial Park were somewhat long, and as the review
was a rather trying one, occupying close upon four hours,
I had arranged to transport the whole of the Americans
back from the review ground to their different quays by
tram, utilizing the tram system attached to the Sydney
Show Ground, which lies adjacent to Centennial Park, and,
further, to give them a good feed previous to boarding the
trams on the return home. My Quartermaster-General&#8217;s
Department quite surpassed themselves in their efforts in
this direction. They arranged for the units of the American
Fleet, on completion of the review, to march in succession
straight on to the Royal Agricultural Society&#8217;s
Grounds, and in doing so to pass through some of the big
buildings used for purposes of exhibits at the show time.
Long, narrow tables were set up in these buildings, parallel
to each other. On these tables, right down each side, were
placed packets containing each four healthy sandwiches,
a large piece of cake, an apple and an orange, a big bun
and cheese. On passing through the building the men
of each company marched in two files, dividing on each
side of the table, and each man picked up his parcel and
moved on to the open Oval. As the tables were cleared
they were immediately replenished by a large staff of
assistants, ready for the succeeding companies. In this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
manner the six thousand Americans received their rations
within half an hour.</p>
<p>Once reaching the Oval and other open spaces of the
society&#8217;s grounds each company was directed to what my
Quartermaster-General called &#8220;a fountain&#8221; (which meant
that piled up around a small beer barrel were plenty of
bottles of all kinds of aerated waters), on reaching which
each company sat down around it, ate the contents of their
packets and drank to their hearts&#8217; content. The return
journey to the ships was accomplished without any accident,
and a day never to be forgotten by those who witnessed
it was past and gone. The enthusiasm of the
immense crowd was raised to the highest pitch when
squadron after squadron of Light Horse galloped past
the saluting point at fairly close intervals, riding hard,
as only Australians can ride, forty squadrons, some 100
strong each.</p>
<p>Previous to my leaving Sydney I held another great
review at Centennial Park. I had promised that I would
give the parents and relations and friends of the lads serving
under the universal service system an opportunity of
seeing for themselves how well the youngsters were doing,
how keen they were, and also the state of efficiency that
they had reached. So I decided to hold a review of those
from 16 to 18 years of age serving in the Metropolitan
area. The day of the review arrived. Over twenty-two
thousand lads were on parade. The Governor-General,
Lord Denman, took the salute. The crowd was certainly
not so large as that which was present at the time
of the visit of the American Fleet, but still it was
enormous. At a certain stage of the review the order
was given for &#8220;Hats off. Three cheers for the King.&#8221;
The rule is on such ceremonial occasions to take the time for
the three cheers from the general officer commanding the
parade, who, riding in front of the line of troops, faces the
saluting point. The three cheers were duly given when, to
my surprise, I heard a shrill cry of &#8220;Tiger!&#8221; and, following
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
it, &#8220;One more cheer.&#8221; I looked round just in time to see
some thousands of hats in the air. The lads provided this
extra entertainment on their own.</p>
<p>The way the boys marched, their soldierly bearing, their
smart appearance and their enthusiasm were the best
answer that the Government, Parliament and the people
of Australia could have had as to the success of the universal
service system which they had brought into force.
Many, indeed, were the proud fathers and mothers on that
day.</p>
<p>One last record. I had commanded the first review of
trainees.</p>
<p>In 1912, on General Hoad&#8217;s death, I was appointed
Chief of the General Staff and First Member of the Military
Board, the highest position in the military forces of the
Commonwealth.</p>
<p>For the constant and willing co-operation of the Australian
officers and men who served under me with such
zeal for so many years I give my sincerest thanks. They
have since proved themselves heroic soldiers in the field.</p>
<p>To Gordon of Khartoum for his three golden rules of
life; to General Downes for the excellent example he gave
of what an upright soldier should be; and to Sergeant
Charles Cameron Kingston for his appreciation of my
work and ever-ready assistance I owe the deepest debt of
gratitude.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF</h3>
</div>

<p>When General Hoad, my predecessor as Chief of the
General Staff, fell ill, the Government decided to grant
him six months&#8217; leave of absence on full pay, and his
duties were to be carried out temporarily by Major Wilson,
R.F.A., <i>p.s.c.</i>, who was the only qualified staff officer at
the time attached to the Headquarters Staff of the Commonwealth
Forces. During these six months Major
Wilson had an exceedingly difficult task. It is needless
to say that all he was able to do was to carry
on ordinary routine work. There was practically no
organization of the department of the Chief of the
Staff. As, on my taking on the duties, Major Wilson&#8217;s
period of service as a loan officer expired and he was due
to return home, I found myself all alone in my glory. A
word of acknowledgment is due to Major Wilson for the
able way in which he battled against the long odds he had
to face.</p>
<p>My first request to the Minister was for the recall of
Captain White, a local officer, who, having been sent
home to the Staff College, had taken high honours, was
attached after completing his staff course to one of the
Directorates of the Army Council, and was earning for
himself an excellent reputation, which he has proved by
his success in the war. He is now Major-General Sir
Brudnel White and Chief of the Staff himself of the
Australian Forces.</p>
<p>My second request was for the loan of another <i>p.s.c.</i>
officer from home. The Minister approved, and within a
short time Captain White and Captain Glasford joined me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
Later on the Minister approved of two more <i>p.s.c.</i> officers
from home on the understanding that each year two local
officers would be selected and sent to Camberley; by doing
so we would in time avoid the necessity of further
borrowing.</p>
<p>A great task was before us. My colleagues on the
Military Board were each faced with somewhat similar
difficulties, but by working together and mutually assisting
each other we managed to make good progress.</p>
<p>Perhaps our most serious problem was to consolidate the
organization of our universal service system. Each
battalion area&mdash;and there were several hundreds, required
an officer and at least one sergeant-major as duly qualified
administrators and instructors; each brigade area wanted
a reliable staff. Our finances would not allow us to import
them; we had to train them locally. The establishment
of local schools of instruction achieved this object in due
course with satisfactory results.</p>
<p>The next and all-important task was the preparation of
sound general and local schemes of defence for the whole
of the Commonwealth&mdash;a far-reaching problem. It not
only required endless care and attention in its conception
and construction, but needed to be so thoroughly set out
as to be easily grasped by all concerned. With the assistance
of Captain White, whose special work this was, the
schemes were completed, and I satisfied myself of their
efficacy and thoroughness some ten months before war
began. No better proof of this is necessary than the
rapidity and ease with which Australia mobilized on the
receipt of the news of the outbreak of war. I am proud
to quote one fact. As an adjunct to the general scheme of
defence I had been most anxious that our Government
should offer the War Office the services of an Australian
division complete in personnel and materiel for service
anywhere in the Empire or out of it if required, and to
be maintained while on service at full strength at the
expence of the Commonwealth for whatever length of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
time it might be wanted. After several months of
persistent effort the Minister obtained the consent of the
Cabinet. The offer was made and accepted by the Home
Government. All details of organization were worked
out. When war was declared the details for mobilizing
the first division were all cut and dried. Who could have
guessed in those days that finally Australia would contribute
somewhere about half a million men to assist the
Mother Country?</p>
<p>In connexion with the preparation of the schemes of
defence a most intricate and perplexing question was the
defence of the northern littoral of the immense island continent.
It would be out of place to attempt to discuss the
matter here. Suffice it to point out that I was instructed
to visit the northern littoral of Australia and submit a
report. Choosing the most suitable season of the
year to make the tour, I left Brisbane in the company
of the then Government Resident of the Northern
Territory, Doctor Gilruth. The voyage along the coast
of Queensland, sailing within the Great Barrier Reef
northwards to Torres Straits, is one of the most interesting
voyages in the world. After leaving the Reef
and clearing Cape York, you enter the Torres Straits and
make for a group of islands, the most important of which
is Thursday Island. It is the headquarters of the pearl
fishing industry and an Imperial coaling station for the
Navy, protected by forts manned by Australian artillery.
The opportunity was given me during my tour to witness
the wonderful diving feats of the coloured crews. Pearl
fishing is a paying business, especially since the great
advance in the price of the mother-of-pearl shells, but one
which demands much nautical skill and the surmounting
of many perils.</p>
<p>One of my duties was the selection of a site for the
construction of the highest power wireless station to be
erected in the southern hemisphere. An entertaining incident
occurred in connexion therewith. Some thirty miles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
inland from Port Darwin, in the neighbourhood of the
railway line to Pine Creek, lay an extensive lake, the waters
of which were an important adjunct to the requirements of
the site. Accompanied by Doctor Gilruth and other
officials we proceeded to visit the locality. Leaving the
train we trekked through the bush to find the lake. By
some means I became detached from our guides and found
myself alone with the representative of our Naval Board.
We were &#8220;bushed&#8221;&mdash;had no idea which way to turn. I
knew enough of bush life to remember that the best thing
to do when bushed is to remain quiet and not attempt to
walk far, light a fire and await the arrival of the rescue
party. This we did, and when, after waiting about an
hour, our friends found us, we were actually only about
a quarter of a mile from the railway line and our train,
where a good luncheon was awaiting us. &#8220;Much ado
about nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the return journey to Melbourne we visited New
Guinea. What a wonderful country! I would advise
those who delight in good reading to purchase Miss Grimshaw&#8217;s
books. Not only are they of overpowering interest,
but they are a living picture of the customs and habits of
the Papuan race.</p>
<p>On our arrival at Port Moresby, the seat of Government,
Colonel Murray, the High Commissioner, invited us to be
his guests. Miss Grimshaw was at the time Colonel
Murray&#8217;s guest also, and I had the pleasure of making the
acquaintance of the charming person whose intrepid and
adventurous nature had made us acquainted with the
fascination of that hitherto hardly-known island and
its mysteries. Its orchids and butterflies alone are
sought for with the greatest zeal by the collectors of the
world.</p>
<p>On my return to Melbourne I found that the inevitable
was approaching. Time, which has but little respect for
persons, had moved on, and I was close up to the age when
the regulations demanded my retirement. On March 18,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
1914, I would overtake my fifty-eighth birthday, and my
active career would close.</p>
<p>Our Government, however, had invited General Ian
Hamilton, at the time holding the appointment of Inspector-General
of Oversea Forces, to make a tour of
inspection of the Commonwealth. As Hamilton was due
to arrive in February of that year I was requested to carry
on till his tour was completed, and it was arranged that I
should retire on August 1, instead of March 18, 1914. The
general left in May. He was specially interested in the
success of the universal service, and his report was a highly
satisfactory one.</p>
<p>Nothing was left to me but to make my last visits of
inspection to the several States and satisfy myself that the
schemes of defence were up to date and in thorough working
order. This I did, and was well pleased with the
results.</p>
<p>I booked my passage by the Orient steamer <i>Orama</i>,
which was leaving Fremantle on July 26, 1914. A fateful
date for me. I had said my last good-byes, and as the
<i>Orama</i> left port we heard of the declaration of war by
Austria against Serbia. Wireless messages reached us
later of Germany&#8217;s declaration against Russia. Then we
got no more news till we were reaching Colombo, about
August 6. The Great World War had commenced on
August 4.</p>
<p>By four days I had missed the opportunity of organizing
and commanding the division which, through my
efforts, Australia had offered to the Home Government a
few months before. General Bridges, my successor,
raised it and led it to Gallipoli, where, unfortunately, he
fell mortally wounded. I have often thought his end
would have been a fitting crown to my life&#8217;s work.
